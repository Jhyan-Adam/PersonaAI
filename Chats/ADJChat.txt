2017/11/13, 19:20 - Jhyan: Please don't tell anyone about you know
2017/11/13, 20:46 - Adela: I don’t even know who this is
2017/11/13, 20:46 - Adela: Anyways
2017/11/13, 20:46 - Jhyan: It's Jhyan
2017/11/13, 20:46 - Jhyan: Sorry I was in a hurry to say that and I forgot that you don't have me as a contact
2017/11/13, 20:46 - Adela: Oh about the thing...?
2017/11/13, 20:47 - Jhyan: The cuts
2017/11/13, 20:51 - Adela: Yeah don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. But you really shouldn’t do it hey, I’m worried
2017/11/13, 20:51 - Jhyan: I actually stopped
2017/11/13, 20:52 - Jhyan: Those were recent but it's because something happened
2017/11/13, 20:52 - Jhyan: I'm not actively cutting
2017/11/13, 20:53 - Jhyan: Thanks though
2017/11/13, 20:54 - Adela: What happened?
2017/11/13, 20:54 - Adela: I’m here to listen hat
2017/11/13, 20:54 - Adela: Hay*
2017/11/13, 20:54 - Jhyan: I can't say
2017/11/13, 20:54 - Jhyan: I don't think I'm allowed to
2017/11/13, 20:55 - Jhyan: You kinda know already so you can put the pieces together
2017/11/13, 20:57 - Jhyan: Shit
2017/11/13, 20:57 - Jhyan: By saying that I told you
2017/11/13, 20:59 - Adela: Is it about Tamara or something?
2017/11/13, 21:00 - Jhyan: Do you think I should tell you
2017/11/13, 21:00 - Adela: Well I’m not exactly gonna force you but I would like to know cause I’m worried about you
2017/11/13, 21:01 - Jhyan: Ok just don't tell her I told you
2017/11/13, 21:01 - Jhyan: I'll say the basic thing
2017/11/13, 21:04 - Jhyan: When I was with her I became happy and wasn't depressed anymore, and that's all well and good, but when she lost feelings I didn't become depressed immediately
2017/11/13, 21:07 - Adela: I won’t tell her though.
2017/11/13, 21:07 - Adela: I promise
2017/11/13, 21:07 - Adela: But like, is the sadness hitting now?
2017/11/13, 21:07 - Jhyan: She stopped caring at all, when she was the only friend that knew and could care because I had told her everything, and she wanted to stay friends but she just got angry when I tried to talk to her about things instead of being supportive, she noticed the flaws in me that she didn't care about before etc
2017/11/13, 21:07 - Jhyan: No the sadness came back slowly, but fast enough that I wasn't prepared and that's why I cut
2017/11/13, 21:08 - Jhyan: And nobody could do anything because nobody knew except her, but she kinda hates me now because I'm depressed
2017/11/13, 21:08 - Jhyan: As if I chose to be like this
2017/11/13, 21:09 - Adela: Bruh I understand how you feel incomplete. There was a guy who I thought I had something with and he used to tell me how special I was and how he wanted to be with me, then one day he stopped talking to me that way and only hit me up when he needed something, then he pretended nothing between us happened and he still acts like that.
2017/11/13, 21:09 - Adela: All I can say is that just like I got over that guy (not too long ago), you’ll get over her, but it takes time
2017/11/13, 21:10 - Jhyan: Yeah but that's not as bad as knowing it was real, knowing (or at least believing) that you'll never get it again, and knowing you lost it
2017/11/13, 21:10 - Jhyan: I did get over her, I just want to stay friends
2017/11/13, 21:11 - Jhyan: Like we were before
2017/11/13, 21:12 - Jhyan: I'm not popular at all, I'm an introvert, I don't go to anything social ever, so the chances of it happening again are extremely low
2017/11/13, 21:14 - Adela: I’m really sorry that’s really sad and I know how it feels
2017/11/13, 21:14 - Adela: Cause what me and this guy had was like idk, we kissed even and he used to say he wanted something even more, then he just leaves me one day
2017/11/13, 21:15 - Jhyan: Yeah idk
2017/11/13, 21:15 - Jhyan: It's shit
2017/11/13, 21:15 - Jhyan: Are your read receipts off
2017/11/13, 21:15 - Jhyan: Coz WhatsApp is saying you haven't read any of these messages
2017/11/13, 21:16 - Adela: Yeah they are
2017/11/13, 21:16 - Adela: So I can ignore people I don’t wanna talk to
2017/11/13, 21:16 - Adela: Youre not one of them
2017/11/13, 21:16 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/11/13, 21:16 - Adela: Don’t worry
2017/11/13, 21:17 - Adela: But yeah, if you ever wanna talk about it, I’m here. And it’s 100% private. It’ll just stay between us
2017/11/13, 21:17 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/11/13, 21:17 - Jhyan: Thanks
2017/11/13, 21:18 - Adela: But yeah, I get where you coming from
2017/11/13, 21:18 - Adela: Hope things get better <3
2017/11/13, 21:20 - Jhyan: The first time I mentioned my depression after she left, she responded with something along the lines of "if that's supposed to make me feel sorry for you, it doesn't work because idc"
2017/11/13, 21:20 - Jhyan: I don't mean to paint her in a bad light
2017/11/13, 21:20 - Adela: Yoh shit, that would break me in half actually
2017/11/13, 21:21 - Adela: No don’t worry. She’s still my best friend
2017/11/13, 21:21 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/11/13, 21:22 - Adela: But yeah that would hurt me like a lot so
2017/11/13, 21:23 - Jhyan: I wasn't even trying to make her feel sorry, I was just drowning and reaching for a lifeboat
2017/11/13, 21:24 - Jhyan: I needed support and the only person who could care either didn't want to or just didn't
2017/11/13, 21:25 - Adela: Yeah understandably so though
2017/11/13, 21:25 - Adela: I care so don’t worry
2017/11/13, 21:25 - Jhyan: Well I actually forgot something
2017/11/13, 21:26 - Jhyan: I'm not entirely depressed anymore
2017/11/13, 21:26 - Adela: That’s good though. things do get better
2017/11/13, 21:27 - Jhyan: Because of that event, because I was happy, the lies in my head that became true because I had experienced them so many times were undermined and I was able to see things objectively
2017/11/13, 21:28 - Jhyan: Like the "fact" that I was ugly for example, but now I see that I'm still a bad person, just a good quality, likeable person
2017/11/13, 21:28 - Jhyan: I can't tell you how I know I'm a bad person when I tell people they tend to get scared (for a lack of better words) of me
2017/11/13, 21:30 - Adela: Bruh you need to stop overthinking and find something that makes you happy.
2017/11/13, 21:30 - Adela: Does your family do that?
2017/11/13, 21:32 - Jhyan: Do what
2017/11/13, 21:33 - Jhyan: Sorry I was doing something else
2017/11/13, 21:36 - Adela: Don’t worry
2017/11/13, 21:37 - Adela: Do they make you happy?
2017/11/13, 21:37 - Jhyan: Well that ties to the things that tell me I'm a bad person
2017/11/13, 21:37 - Jhyan: It's a weird thing with my family
2017/11/13, 21:37 - Jhyan: I hardly talk to them or anything
2017/11/13, 21:38 - Jhyan: They don't know who I am
2017/11/13, 21:38 - Adela: That’s shit and must be really lonely. I’m sorry
2017/11/13, 21:38 - Jhyan: I've kept myself hidden because every time I've shown my personal ideologies they get worried and angry and don't treat me like I'm "Jhyan"
2017/11/13, 21:39 - Jhyan: They try to change me back to "Jhyan"
2017/11/13, 21:39 - Jhyan: Yeah and Tamara is the only person I've opened up to fully
2017/11/13, 21:40 - Jhyan: Or even more than in just a superficial way
2017/11/13, 21:40 - Adela: That makes sense. It must be really sad to lose that. I understand why you would feel like this
2017/11/13, 21:41 - Jhyan: That's also why I really still want to be friends
2017/11/13, 21:41 - Adela: Yeah you guys should work at that
2017/11/13, 21:41 - Jhyan: She knew who I was and still liked me (even as a friend) and I've never had anyone do that
2017/11/13, 21:42 - Jhyan: Well I have a few theories as to why she is being like this
2017/11/13, 21:42 - Jhyan: One is that she doesn't want me to think she likes me more than a friend or doesn't want me to try to be what we were again and so she pretends not to care or forces herself not to
2017/11/13, 21:43 - Jhyan: Another is that when her feelings faded, all of them did, including just liking me as a friend
2017/11/13, 21:44 - Jhyan: Is it uncomfortable for you that I'm saying these things
2017/11/13, 21:46 - Jhyan: She is also angry on the subject of my depression because of an unknown reason
2017/11/13, 21:47 - Jhyan: But I've tried not talking about that and she always unconsciously steers the conversation back towards that
2017/11/13, 21:47 - Jhyan: I shouldn't be telling you this much
2017/11/13, 21:48 - Adela: No it isn’t
2017/11/13, 21:48 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/11/13, 21:49 - Adela: Maybe she’s also a bit confused and maybe you’re the reason? Or maybe you just remind her of something of her past that she messed up? I’m not sure
2017/11/13, 21:49 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/11/13, 21:49 - Jhyan: Wdym by confused
2017/11/13, 21:50 - Jhyan: I think I'm gonna sleep now though so
2017/11/13, 21:50 - Jhyan: Good night
2017/11/13, 21:51 - Adela: Maybe she doesnt understand what she feels even?
2017/11/13, 21:51 - Adela: Goodnight 🌼
2017/11/22, 18:58 - Jhyan: Hey
2017/11/22, 18:58 - Jhyan: What's up
2017/11/22, 19:11 - Adela: Hi hi
2017/11/22, 19:13 - Jhyan: I'm bored of studying but I'm forced to pretend I am so I can't do anything but use my phone
2017/11/22, 19:16 - Adela: Oooh that sounds wonderful
2017/11/22, 19:16 - Adela: I studied and now Ive been binge watching Netflix
2017/11/22, 19:16 - Jhyan: Which show
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: Gossip Girl
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: Really basic but anyways
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: It’s a distraction from the hell of exams
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Jhyan: I think I've studied everything but I just know that there's gonna be something I didn't study
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: But tomorrow, we’re 70% sone with em
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Jhyan: I don't know that show
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: Really?!
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: Like you’ve never even heard of it?
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Adela: Yeah I feel like I’m missing something
2017/11/22, 19:17 - Jhyan: But I bet I could list some you haven't heard of
2017/11/22, 19:18 - Jhyan: Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, Agents of SHIELD, LOST
2017/11/22, 19:19 - Jhyan: Ok you might know some of those
2017/11/22, 19:19 - Jhyan: You know in the science exam, I didn't have my calculator
2017/11/22, 19:20 - Jhyan: So I was left to do some super calculations to get some of the answers
2017/11/22, 19:20 - Adela: I know none of those
2017/11/22, 19:20 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/11/22, 19:20 - Adela: Oml I would actually die
2017/11/22, 19:20 - Adela: Wtf!
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Adela: I’m scared I am going to forget mine for tomorrow
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Jhyan: Two are by DC, one is by MARVEL, and the other is kinda famous
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Adela: Imagine calculating with pi  in your head
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Adela: Uhh I know none though 🙈
2017/11/22, 19:21 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/11/22, 19:22 - Jhyan: And I realized a mistake afterwards
2017/11/22, 19:23 - Adela: What?
2017/11/22, 19:23 - Jhyan: I had 7/24 and needed to get it into a decimal, and I multiplied it by 4.2, because I didn't account for the fact that multiplying it would make it 4 less, not 6
2017/11/22, 19:23 - Adela: Oh damnn
2017/11/22, 19:23 - Adela: I’ll pretend I understand
2017/11/22, 19:24 - Jhyan: Oh wait I just checked with a calculator and it's right
2017/11/22, 19:24 - Jhyan: So I'm good
2017/11/22, 19:25 - Jhyan: Ok I could explain it but it'll probably be boring
2017/11/22, 19:27 - Adela: No don’t worry, it’s fine
2017/11/22, 19:27 - Adela: So are you better now? Last time we spoke, you were in a bad place
2017/11/22, 19:28 - Jhyan: No
2017/11/22, 19:28 - Jhyan: Wait was the perception formed that I wasn't like this before
2017/11/22, 19:33 - Jhyan: Ok so it's like 4(25-1) but you pretend you don't do what's in the bracket first so it's like 4X25 + 4X-1 which is 100 + -4 so that's 96, and in order to get 100, you also have to add the 0.2 so that it's 4.2X25 + 4.2X-1 which is 105-4.2 and I just realized my answer was wrong by 0.8
2017/11/22, 19:33 - Jhyan: Coz 105-4.2 is 100.8
2017/11/22, 19:33 - Jhyan: Not 100
2017/11/22, 19:36 - Adela: Yoh which question was this for?
2017/11/22, 19:36 - Jhyan: It was density and I got 7 remainder 150 or something
2017/11/22, 19:38 - Jhyan: And I discovered a way to turn remainders into fractions/decimals by myself long ago which is the remainder divided by the divisor or whatever
2017/11/22, 19:38 - Jhyan: I can't remember or fully
2017/11/22, 19:39 - Jhyan: So it equalled 7 and 150/??? And I converted that fraction until I got 7/24 or something and converted that into a decimal
2017/11/22, 19:40 - Jhyan: But these numbers are actually all wrong except for any instance of 7 or 24
2017/11/22, 19:40 - Jhyan: I don't remember the actual numbers
2017/11/22, 19:40 - Jhyan: Wait brb
2017/11/22, 19:40 - Adela: Okay....
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: My brain feels like it gained 5 billion brain cells from this conversation alone
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: To turn remainder into decimal, convert the fraction that is the remainder over the divisor to a decimal and add it to the total.
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: Haha
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: Yup
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: That’s exactly what to do
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: But I was self taught
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: Maths is the worst
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: You’re very smart
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: Actually where did you learn that from
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Adela: Like a genius actually
2017/11/22, 19:41 - Jhyan: Thanks
2017/11/22, 19:44 - Jhyan: But how did _you_ know how to do that coz it seems like a thing that they don't teach since I've never learned it and nobody I know except for you knows it
2017/11/22, 19:46 - Adela: I learnt it some where last year
2017/11/22, 19:46 - Jhyan: Oh
2017/11/22, 19:47 - Jhyan: It's really useful though
2017/11/22, 19:47 - Adela: the maths at my old school was different
2017/11/22, 19:47 - Adela: It’s ganggg useful
2017/11/22, 19:47 - Adela: I need it all the time
2017/11/22, 19:47 - Jhyan: And nobody gets taught it
2017/11/22, 19:48 - Jhyan: Like I've been wondering for years before this how you turned a remainder into a decimal coz I prefer working with them but the maths teacher had always been like shhh... We don't like when you use decimals, use fractions
2017/11/22, 20:15 - Adela: Urgh i hate that
2017/11/22, 20:15 - Adela: I hate fractions
2017/11/22, 20:15 - Jhyan: Also
2017/11/22, 20:16 - Jhyan: Actually nvm
2017/11/22, 20:16 - Jhyan: Bye
2017/12/06, 20:43 - Jhyan: Tonight reminded me of something
2017/12/06, 20:44 - Jhyan: You said this as if you're not
2017/12/06, 21:00 - Adela: lol i have a good memory

Clyde: "Oh it's a Japanese animated series, the best of which being Cory in The House lol"

2017/12/20, 23:48 - Jhyan: Why
2017/12/20, 23:49 - Jhyan: Well for one, that you already know, I was cutting because of it
2017/12/20, 23:49 - Jhyan: The fact that it's worse now
2017/12/20, 23:50 - Jhyan: The contrast of happiness to depression
2017/12/20, 23:50 - Jhyan: The depression was worse this time
2017/12/20, 23:53 - Jhyan: Sometimes I get the depression equivalent of a panic attack
2017/12/20, 23:55 - Jhyan: I either breathe too fast or don't breathe, I lose all motivation, even to do things like stand up, so I fall to the floor. If I'm eating I don't want to keep doing so
2017/12/20, 23:56 - Jhyan: Recently I stopped having those coz of the thing
2017/12/20, 23:57 - Jhyan: But I'm scared

2017/12/21, 00:33 - Adela: i’m sorry you have to go through depression and shi, it’s not easy, but it does get better and that’s hard to believe when you’re sad but it is true
2017/12/21, 00:33 - Adela: i know from experience
2017/12/21, 00:33 - Adela: now what was that good thing in your life rn?
2017/12/21, 00:33 - Jhyan: I keep overthinking things a lot

2017/12/23, 12:53 - Jhyan: Would you say it's funny
2017/12/23, 19:53 - Adela: i don’t get ittt
2017/12/23, 19:53 - Adela: i’m really stoopid
2017/12/23, 19:53 - Jhyan: Whyyyy
2017/12/23, 19:53 - Adela: idkkk
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: Memory is an intelligent trait
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: I just have a different one
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Adela: mmmh i guess
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Adela: which one?
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: I don't know the name
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Adela: the ability to interpret data and create data
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: I forgot the word
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Adela: because you’re a genius
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: No
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: Anyway the faces are mirrored
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Adela: you are clever as hell
2017/12/23, 19:54 - Jhyan: And the names are mirrored
2017/12/23, 19:55 - Jhyan: Where do you get that from
2017/12/23, 19:55 - Jhyan: That idea
2017/12/23, 19:55 - Jhyan: I only told you one thing I did in the exam
2017/12/23, 19:56 - Jhyan: Wyd
2017/12/23, 19:56 - Adela: i mean, you can code and make games and shii and animations and i can’t do that. you’re so good with computers and programmes
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Jhyan: I'm braaing
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Jhyan: Memory is so useful in that
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Adela: haha i get it
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Jhyan: Although I do figure out faster ways of doing things
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Adela: but who are the people?
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Adela: you do!
2017/12/23, 19:57 - Adela: have more faith in yourself. you’re really clever hey
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Jhyan: ?
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Jhyan: It's also learning
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Adela: you’ll make it far in life because you can do things most people can’t whereas i’m better at the things most people can do
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Adela: but you’re a genius
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Jhyan: Brb
2017/12/23, 19:58 - Adela: i mean, who are the people who are in that meme
2017/12/23, 19:59 - Jhyan: Elon musk
2017/12/23, 20:00 - Jhyan: Wait I'm tired
2017/12/23, 20:00 - Jhyan: I can't think of an argument rn
2017/12/23, 20:01 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/12/23, 20:07 - Jhyan: You could be a scientist or could work in corporate or be an engineer or whatever
2017/12/23, 20:07 - Jhyan: The point is you'll still be able to get a good job and be really successful
2017/12/23, 20:07 - Jhyan: Especially because you'd probably even get more scholarship opportunities than me
2017/12/23, 20:07 - Jhyan: So you'd be hired easier
2017/12/23, 20:08 - Jhyan: I could be an entrepreneur or a better anything than most people but it'd be a waste because I'd be more suited to be a theorist or an inventor
2017/12/23, 20:08 - Jhyan: It depends on how you measure success
2017/12/23, 20:34 - Jhyan: ?
2017/12/23, 21:55 - Jhyan: Well good night
2017/12/23, 22:25 - Adela: mmh it does, but right now, the world needs unique people who do something different otherwise you just end up being dime a dozen, but i think i want to get into the corporate field actually. but yeah, you could be like a programmer or a billion who creates software or a media like Facebook, because you can code really well.
2017/12/23, 23:15 - Adela: good night
2017/12/24, 09:43 - Jhyan: You could code really well
2017/12/24, 09:43 - Jhyan: It's actually very reliant on memory
2017/12/24, 09:44 - Jhyan: As it's a language
2017/12/24, 09:44 - Jhyan: I'd be better as the designer of what I want people to code
2017/12/24, 09:44 - Jhyan: It has vocabulary
2017/12/24, 09:44 - Jhyan: I'm shit at language
2017/12/24, 09:50 - Jhyan: I won't have good reception on the drive soon so
2017/12/24, 10:34 - Adela: where are you going?
2017/12/24, 10:34 - Adela: i don’t think you are, you’re good at afrikaans

2017/12/24, 18:25 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 18:25 - Jhyan: There's no reason not to be
2017/12/24, 18:26 - Adela: yeah i wouldn’t be mean to anyone who hasn’t given me a reason to be
2017/12/24, 18:26 - Adela: plus you’re a friend so
2017/12/24, 18:27 - Jhyan: Anyway thanks for doing it coz it helps when I'm feeling down
2017/12/24, 18:28 - Jhyan: Or even when I'm feeling the normal amount of sadness
2017/12/24, 18:29 - Adela: i’m really sorry you experience that. i do too sometimes but then i listen to music to help me out
2017/12/24, 18:29 - Jhyan: Yeah but there's a difference between doing nothing, doing something positive, and doing something negative
2017/12/24, 18:29 - Jhyan: There's a short story about my music
2017/12/24, 18:29 - Adela: ahh you’re always welcome, i’m glad i’m a help in some way :):
2017/12/24, 18:32 - Jhyan: When I was in Greece, and I was happy because of Tam, I had all my favourite songs (besides the sad ones because I was happy) and I listened to them all the time since there was no internet for most of the time and I only had 25 offline ones. When I was back in Johannesburg, I would listen to those songs and feel happier because of the memories in Greece. But ever since I became depressed again my music is all bittersweet and makes me feel sad.
2017/12/24, 18:35 - Adela: yeah i completely understand, i’ve had the same experience.
sometimes when i listen to the music i used to listen to when i was happy or with someone who i miss, it brings me sadness instead of the happiness it used to.
but like recently idk, i feel random pangs of sadness that come from nowhere.
but like happy music kinda helps, but sometimes you need sad music to sort of fill your soul and speak to your mood and emotions.
also... it’s good to allow yourself to be sad sometimes, it what makes us alive.
if you’re never sad, you wouldn’t know how being happy felt.
2017/12/24, 18:35 - Jhyan: There's those sound apps or websites that are nice
2017/12/24, 18:36 - Jhyan: They can play rain, thunder, wind, waves, etc. which is calming
2017/12/24, 18:36 - Adela: ahhh that’s really nice.
2017/12/24, 18:36 - Adela: you’re listening to that?
2017/12/24, 18:37 - Jhyan: Sometimes
2017/12/24, 18:37 - Jhyan: I got the app on my phone long time ago
2017/12/24, 18:37 - Jhyan: It's called asoftmurmur if you ever want to try it
2017/12/24, 18:37 - Jhyan: asoftmurmur.com
2017/12/24, 18:40 - Jhyan: The same is true if you were never happy
2017/12/24, 18:46 - Jhyan: What kind of music do you listen to?
2017/12/24, 18:47 - Adela: i listen to a wide variety of genres, but i like r&b and soul
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Adela: and then sad songs as well
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Adela: and then rap and hip hop
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Adela: sure, maybe i’ll give it a go
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Adela: what about you?
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Jhyan: Uh
2017/12/24, 18:48 - Jhyan: Indie

2017/12/24, 18:49 - Jhyan: If Coldplay is considered that still or ever was
2017/12/24, 18:50 - Jhyan: Old classics like Sweet Dreams and Africa by Toto
2017/12/24, 18:51 - Jhyan: Or my personal favourite, the Guardians of The Galaxy soundtrack
2017/12/24, 18:51 - Jhyan: Have you heard Africa?
2017/12/24, 18:51 - Adela: i like alternative

2017/12/24, 18:52 - Adela: nope i haven’t
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Jhyan: There's like subcategories
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Adela: i love “hooked on a feeling”
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Adela: eh i’m not sure of the sub categories
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Jhyan: Yohhhh h h h h h  h  h  h  h   h   h   h
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Jhyan: Lol

2017/12/24, 18:52 - Adela: is it good? 😂
2017/12/24, 18:52 - Jhyan: It's good

2017/12/24, 18:53 - Adela: have you ever listened to “red is blue” from hoodwinked?
2017/12/24, 18:53 - Adela: idk
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Jhyan: What would Pumped Up Kicks be considered
2017/12/24, 18:53 - Adela: i like jazz i guess
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Jhyan: Old pop?
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Jhyan: Nah I'll try
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Adela: alternative sad songs? lemme make a new subcategory real quick
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Jhyan: I guess that would be what I listen to
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Adela: uhm i guess.
2017/12/24, 18:54 - Adela: i like that song yoh
2017/12/24, 18:55 - Jhyan: Dead Sea, Submarines, Charlie Boy, Obstacles, etc
2017/12/24, 18:55 - Adela: it’s quite sad to me, but i like the instrumental element to the song
2017/12/24, 18:55 - Jhyan: 3 of those are by The Lumineers
2017/12/24, 18:55 - Jhyan: I like The Lumineers
2017/12/24, 18:56 - Jhyan: Yoh I need to write down a list of all the songs I need to listen to
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Jhyan: Although I only like 4 of their songs
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Jhyan: Ummm
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Jhyan: Oh yeah Milky Chance
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Adela: damn i haven’t heard of those artists, i’m so behind in life
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Jhyan: No they're super indie
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Jhyan: I'm not surprised
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Adela: yoh you listen to such different music, originality is a great trait honestly
2017/12/24, 18:57 - Adela: indie is great
2017/12/24, 18:58 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 18:58 - Jhyan: The only two I like are Stolen Dance and Down By The River
2017/12/24, 18:58 - Adela: cool beans
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Adela: idk my music taste is kinda weird
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Jhyan: Lol isn't mine more weird
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Jhyan: Indie AF
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Adela: but all i know is that i hate the popular music of today, with their objectifying women and shit
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Adela: that’s cool though
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Jhyan: It's shit
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Adela: yours is interesting
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Adela: and unique and stuffs
2017/12/24, 18:59 - Jhyan: Coldplay doesn't do that
2017/12/24, 19:00 - Jhyan: They also make more instrumental sounding songs than other pop
2017/12/24, 19:01 - Jhyan: Have you ever thought about how there's only 3 years left of school?
2017/12/24, 19:03 - Jhyan: Atlas Genius is another one which is like even more indie than The Lumineers which is a level I didn't think was possible
2017/12/24, 20:28 - Jhyan: Merry Christmas Eve
2017/12/24, 21:03 - Adela: it really is
2017/12/24, 21:04 - Adela: coldplay is really good. i was listening to them today.
2017/12/24, 21:04 - Adela: my fingers are frozen rn
2017/12/24, 21:04 - Jhyan: Cool
2017/12/24, 21:04 - Adela: damn. 4 is it not?

2017/12/24, 21:05 - Jhyan: I like The Scientist
2017/12/24, 21:05 - Jhyan: In My Place
2017/12/24, 21:05 - Jhyan: Omg thanks I wasn't thinking properly
2017/12/24, 21:05 - Jhyan: 4 years is better
2017/12/24, 21:06 - Adela: fix you, true love, magic, vida la viva
2017/12/24, 21:06 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 21:06 - Jhyan: Wait I can't remember any
2017/12/24, 21:06 - Jhyan: Hold on lemme check
2017/12/24, 21:07 - Jhyan: Up and Up
2017/12/24, 21:07 - Adela: i can’t think of more lol
2017/12/24, 21:08 - Jhyan: Paradise
2017/12/24, 21:08 - Jhyan: Hymn For The Weekend
2017/12/24, 21:08 - Jhyan: Yeah those are mine
2017/12/24, 21:08 - Jhyan: Brb
2017/12/24, 21:10 - Adela: omg i love both of those songs
2017/12/24, 21:10 - Adela: my hands needa warm up. it’s hard to type with em cold
2017/12/24, 21:34 - Jhyan: Shame man
2017/12/24, 21:34 - Jhyan: Are you outside?
2017/12/24, 21:34 - Jhyan: Do you have a heater?
2017/12/24, 21:38 - Adela: i was, but now i’m indoors and they’re kinda defrosting so typing doesn’t hurt as much as it did
2017/12/24, 21:39 - Jhyan: Defrosting
2017/12/24, 21:39 - Jhyan: Thawing is a nice word for that
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Adela: yes
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Adela: thawing is better
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Adela: there you go, being smarter than me again
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Jhyan: Nooooo
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Jhyan: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2017/12/24, 21:40 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/12/24, 21:41 - Jhyan: Ok I'll stop denying it it's probably annoying
2017/12/24, 21:41 - Adela: yes
2017/12/24, 21:41 - Adela: yessssssss
2017/12/24, 21:41 - Adela: no it’s fine if you deny it even though i know the truth. you’re a genius
2017/12/24, 21:43 - Jhyan: If you look at it from a better, less objective standpoint
2017/12/24, 21:43 - Jhyan: You'd include EQ
2017/12/24, 21:43 - Jhyan: Which I am extremely retarded in
2017/12/24, 21:43 - Adela: mmmh no not really
2017/12/24, 21:43 - Adela: i find that hard to believe
2017/12/24, 21:44 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 21:44 - Jhyan: I am
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Jhyan: I'm introverted, which is already bad, then I'm socially awkward
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Jhyan: Do you know how hard I've tried this year
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Jhyan: Every break was hard
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Adela: that makes two of us. i generally struggle making friends and getting along with people
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Adela: yoh same ☹
2017/12/24, 21:45 - Jhyan: Woah
2017/12/24, 21:46 - Jhyan: Are you serious
2017/12/24, 21:46 - Jhyan: But you're popular-ish
2017/12/24, 21:48 - Jhyan: You know looking back on it it's actually believable
2017/12/24, 21:49 - Jhyan: Well I'm actually grouping social interactions with EQ
2017/12/24, 21:50 - Jhyan: Which I'm not sure fall under that
2017/12/24, 21:56 - Adela: i’m not really
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: Idl
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: *idk
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Adela: yeah i am, i feel really outta place with most people and i feel really awkward and stuff
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: So what are you up to on Christmas Eve?
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Adela: i also feel like the conversation is contrived most of the time
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: Oh
2017/12/24, 21:57 - Jhyan: Yeah exactly
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Jhyan: That's like my experience
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Adela: uhm i need to pack because im leaving tomorrow
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Adela: and then i’m gonna eat some yoghurt and watch netflix
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Adela: yeah socialising sucks
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Jhyan: And people say it isn't like that
2017/12/24, 21:58 - Adela: there are very few people i feel comfortable around
2017/12/24, 21:59 - Jhyan: But you think it is
2017/12/24, 21:59 - Jhyan: I also have a lack of trust of people
2017/12/24, 22:01 - Adela: yeah. i’m the exact same. i struggle to open up to people fully and i hardly trust people. i always feel like they’re talking about me behind my back somewhere
2017/12/24, 22:01 - Jhyan: I constantly tell myself that they don't like me or that they will eventually grow tired of me
2017/12/24, 22:01 - Jhyan: Things like that
2017/12/24, 22:02 - Jhyan: Yeah and it's even worse that in a lot of cases it's true
2017/12/24, 22:02 - Jhyan: Like Dominic made plans without me on purpose
2017/12/24, 22:03 - Jhyan: I mean it could've been an accident but it _was_ the _one time_ that I wasn't there at break
2017/12/24, 22:04 - Jhyan: Coincidence hardly exists
2017/12/24, 22:05 - Jhyan: And in the past people used to exclude me and tell secrets that they intentionally kept from me to get a reaction
2017/12/24, 22:05 - Jhyan: Oh no
2017/12/24, 22:05 - Jhyan: I just realized something
2017/12/24, 22:07 - Jhyan: I can't tell you it'd be gossiping, talking behind their back
2017/12/24, 22:07 - Jhyan: I need to go shower now
2017/12/24, 22:11 - Adela: omg that’s exactly what i tell myself all the time
2017/12/24, 22:11 - Jhyan: Wow
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: yeah i always self-sabotage because i feel like people don’t like me a lot of the time
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: Also it's weird that I picked this up at the same time
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: also gossiping is okay sometimes, let it all out
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: Really
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: Are you sure
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: Ok I'll tell you after I shower lol
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: yeah i’m sure
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: Cliff hanger
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: HAHAHAHAHA
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: okay sure.
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: cliff hanger
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Jhyan: *evil laugh*
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: *imagines some fat guy with one hand on a cliff*
2017/12/24, 22:12 - Adela: *and he’s falling rn
2017/12/24, 22:13 - Adela: mwahahahaha
2017/12/24, 22:13 - Adela: shit i need to pack
2017/12/24, 22:24 - Jhyan: Oh man packing is the worst
2017/12/24, 22:25 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/12/24, 22:25 - Jhyan: Well
2017/12/24, 22:25 - Jhyan: Soooo
2017/12/24, 22:26 - Adela: it really is,
2017/12/24, 22:26 - Jhyan: I opened up to Tamara, and she knew that weakness from my past - them keeping secrets from me made me paranoid about secrets now
2017/12/24, 22:27 - Jhyan: And idk why but she likes doing that
2017/12/24, 22:27 - Jhyan: Like she asked me a question any John
2017/12/24, 22:27 - Jhyan: And I asked who was asking
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Adela: oh yeah, idk things between the two of you’s relationships kinda become tainted with whatever
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Adela: happens to me a lot with people
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Adela: and it’s sad
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Adela: maybe y’all will get what you had again
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Jhyan: And she said it's none of your business, which is wrong, because I we involved
2017/12/24, 22:28 - Adela: i really hope you do because you sound like you were really happy with her in your life
2017/12/24, 22:29 - Jhyan: And then she couldn't win the argument as to why it was in fact my business so she fully admitted to doing it on purpose
2017/12/24, 22:29 - Adela: i hate it when people say that when they involve you, as soon as they ask you something, you kinda get involved
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: Yeah it's so sad to say the truth as to why this happened
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: Basically
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Adela: why did it happen?
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: When we first started out I was still kinda depressed
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: So I was skeptical
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: I call it "pessimisticly realistic"
2017/12/24, 22:30 - Jhyan: I expect the worst
2017/12/24, 22:31 - Jhyan: And usually it's actually fucking correct AF
2017/12/24, 22:31 - Jhyan: Which is really shit
2017/12/24, 22:31 - Jhyan: Anyway so I predicted how we'd break up
2017/12/24, 22:31 - Jhyan: All the different ways
2017/12/24, 22:31 - Jhyan: Of all, one stood out
2017/12/24, 22:32 - Jhyan: She would get tired of me and start to see my bad qualities like social anxiety
2017/12/24, 22:32 - Jhyan: And that's exactly what happens
2017/12/24, 22:32 - Jhyan: *happened
2017/12/24, 22:33 - Jhyan: Well idk if that's why we seperated because when I tried to figure that out I only came to the conclusion that it was a mix of many, many factors
2017/12/24, 22:33 - Adela: yeah i’m the exact same
2017/12/24, 22:33 - Jhyan: But it _was_ why she didn't want to be friends after
2017/12/24, 22:34 - Jhyan: She didn't want to try anything
2017/12/24, 22:34 - Jhyan: I kept talking to her on WhatsApp but it's weird
2017/12/24, 22:35 - Jhyan: My happiness pushed away the voice saying the predictions
2017/12/24, 22:35 - Adela: i’m really sorry hey, but at the same time, if the thing that tore you apart was who you are, then she is at fault and not you. you need someone to love and accept you for who you are, and even though it’s hard, she’s one of my best friends, but she didn’t deserve you if she was driven away by what made you who you are
2017/12/24, 22:35 - Jhyan: Haha
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Adela: and so what? you’re sad. who isn’t? i’m sad a lot of the times, but i found someone who takes me with the good and the bad and loves me for that and that’s exactly what you need. i have family to support me and friends and you also have that, and if in the case that you don’t, i’m always here
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Jhyan: Nobody would like me
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Adela: you are who you are, and you shouldnt change that.
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Jhyan: I have none of that
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Adela: that is not true. i think you’re an amazing guy, you just need someone to see the true you and then you’re good to go.
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Jhyan: Well I guess you're a friend that does that
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Jhyan: But
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Jhyan: Didn't I tell you
2017/12/24, 22:36 - Adela: well then i’m here, i’ll always be here for you whether you’re sad or happy because i’m that sort of person
2017/12/24, 22:37 - Jhyan: My family doesn't accept that and most of my friends don't know about that
2017/12/24, 22:37 - Jhyan: Yeah I realized
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Adela: i’m sure your friends would be there for you no matter what, because that’s what friends are supposed to do
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Jhyan: Tam saw the true me but didn't like it
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Jhyan: My friends would get tired
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Adela: that’s really sad,
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Adela: i’m sorry that happened to you
2017/12/24, 22:38 - Jhyan: They'd start doing things like hanging out in different places and not telling me
2017/12/24, 22:39 - Adela: don’t let that voice inside your head tell you that. i know, i have the same little voice telling me shit like this
2017/12/24, 22:39 - Adela: you have to ignore it though
2017/12/24, 22:39 - Jhyan: And my family had a brief glimpse of my depression and ideals and immediately started getting angry at _ME_ and would've suggested counseling abs therapy etc
2017/12/24, 22:39 - Jhyan: And if I said no they'd force me
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Adela: have you tried antidepressants or therapy? it helps people a lot and it’s a good way of being in charge of your own mental health. it helps to talk to someone and antidepressants ease the pain
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Jhyan: No
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Jhyan: I don't want to
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Jhyan: It's shit I know but I can't do that
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Adela: i know, i was incredibly, incredibly sad in may. like i was living for absolutely nothing and felt like i was stuck in this loophole that kept spinning me into a blackhole that sucked all the happiness out of me
2017/12/24, 22:40 - Jhyan: Therapists don't really care
2017/12/24, 22:41 - Adela: mmmh thats true, but some good ones help you
2017/12/24, 22:41 - Adela: i went to one that could not even look me in the eye, fucking sucked
2017/12/24, 22:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 22:42 - Jhyan: It's extremely unlikely that I'll meet someone who would work with me
2017/12/24, 22:43 - Jhyan: I'm not social at all and I wouldn't talk to people
2017/12/24, 22:43 - Jhyan: The only chance is in university
2017/12/24, 22:43 - Jhyan: But it's still a small chance
2017/12/24, 22:43 - Adela: mmmh. are you talking about romantically?
2017/12/24, 22:43 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/24, 22:44 - Jhyan: Also I don't want to find someone only to break up later on
2017/12/24, 22:44 - Jhyan: So that mentality makes it even less likely
2017/12/24, 22:44 - Jhyan: Idk I'm sorry I shouldn't just vent this
2017/12/24, 22:45 - Adela: mmh you have to put yourself out there romantically. sure, relationships end but they also last and they give you this unexplainable feeling of happiness when they’re there
2017/12/24, 22:45 - Adela: the end of them is never easy but you have to take the good with the bad, and youll never experience the good if you don’t open your heart
2017/12/24, 22:45 - Jhyan: That is like life
2017/12/24, 22:45 - Adela: you should, it’s fine. i’m not gonna think of you any differently or tell anyone or get tired of you
2017/12/24, 22:45 - Jhyan: I think there's more bad then good
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Jhyan: Oh shit
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Jhyan: Wait
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Jhyan: Nvm
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Adela: there’s good, but you take it with the bad. there’s a lot of good actually
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Adela: you just need to find the girl who is perfect for you
2017/12/24, 22:46 - Jhyan: Wait have I told you my career plan yet
2017/12/24, 22:47 - Jhyan: And if not have I referenced it
2017/12/24, 22:48 - Jhyan: I did once
2017/12/24, 22:48 - Jhyan: Idk if you were there
2017/12/24, 22:50 - Jhyan: If I haven't I need to think if I should tell you yet or not
2017/12/24, 22:50 - Jhyan: Because it's not exactly an appetizer
2017/12/24, 22:50 - Jhyan: It's a quadruple main course
2017/12/24, 22:51 - Jhyan: Of that metaphor works
2017/12/24, 22:51 - Jhyan: *if
2017/12/24, 22:58 - Jhyan: Ok I need to sleep now
2017/12/24, 22:58 - Jhyan: Good night

2017/12/24, 23:55 - Adela: sorry i ended up having to charge my phone in my room and ended up getting caught in the living room
2017/12/25, 09:06 - Jhyan: Merry Christmas Adela
2017/12/25, 10:27 - Jhyan: Have I told you about the 16 personalities test
2017/12/25, 10:27 - Jhyan: You should do it
2017/12/25, 10:27 - Jhyan: It's online
2017/12/25, 10:27 - Jhyan: And it's a quiz
2017/12/25, 10:27 - Jhyan: But it's actually approved by psychologists
2017/12/25, 10:28 - Jhyan: It uses the Myers-Briggs personality trait system
2017/12/25, 10:28 - Jhyan: I'm INTJ, The Architect, or The Mastermind
2017/12/25, 10:48 - Adela: merry christmas jhyan
2017/12/25, 10:48 - Adela: i think i should do this personality quiz. i’ll do it as soon as i get home
2017/12/25, 10:48 - Jhyan: I was re-reading my page and it's super accurate
2017/12/25, 10:49 - Jhyan: Cool
2017/12/25, 10:49 - Jhyan: Also when you read a page on the personality type there are extra parts like strengths and weaknesses
2017/12/25, 10:49 - Jhyan: If you're on a mobile device they'll be a button at the bottom
2017/12/25, 10:50 - Jhyan: Otherwise I think they're tabs
2017/12/25, 11:22 - Adela: okay sure, it sounds really cool.
2017/12/25, 11:22 - Adela: anyways, what are your plans for christmas?
2017/12/25, 11:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 11:22 - Jhyan: Uh

2017/12/25, 11:23 - Jhyan: And now we're gonna open presents
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: Cool
2017/12/25, 11:25 - Adela: i’m so jelly. i am still yet to eat
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: oouu hope you enjoy and get the things you want
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: but christmas is about the love, not the gifts
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: I didn't get anything
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: but gifts are great too
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: I got some money
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: anyways, hope you enjoy
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: My mom doesn't have money right now so my present is delayed
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: Like she has money but no excess money
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: ahh that’s better. now you can choose what to spend it on
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Adela: oh okay
2017/12/25, 11:26 - Jhyan: In April
2017/12/25, 11:27 - Adela: oh that makes sense
2017/12/25, 11:27 - Jhyan: It's a OnePlus 5

2017/12/25, 11:49 - Jhyan: Wait sorry
2017/12/25, 11:49 - Jhyan: That might be rude

2017/12/25, 12:19 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>

2017/12/25, 12:27 - Jhyan: Yohhhh I just found out something
2017/12/25, 12:27 - Jhyan: When you rotate the lens it moves a thing that blocks the holographic HUD
2017/12/25, 12:28 - Jhyan: And it's a line that goes over the pictures like of the mountain or people or portrait person
2017/12/25, 12:28 - Jhyan: The icons at the bottom
2017/12/25, 12:31 - Adela: yoh i wanna learn how to take nice pictures with a retro camera
2017/12/25, 12:31 - Adela: i love polaroid cameras though
2017/12/25, 12:31 - Jhyan: And it changes the mode
2017/12/25, 12:31 - Jhyan: Yeah I have a modern Polaroid camera
2017/12/25, 14:02 - Jhyan: I can't swim in the ocean

2017/12/25, 15:31 - Adela: omg have you been cutting again? :(
2017/12/25, 15:31 - Adela: don’t do that to yourselff
2017/12/25, 15:31 - Jhyan: Everybody went to the beach and only my grandparents are still here
2017/12/25, 15:31 - Jhyan: No
2017/12/25, 15:31 - Jhyan: I decided to stop
2017/12/25, 15:31 - Jhyan: But purely because I didn't want to get found out
2017/12/25, 15:32 - Jhyan: I would've kept going if I could erase the scars
2017/12/25, 15:32 - Jhyan: They take forever to go away
2017/12/25, 15:32 - Jhyan: They're still pink coloured
2017/12/25, 15:33 - Jhyan: Where are you now actually
2017/12/25, 15:43 - Adela: i’m in the airport right now
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Jhyan: How long is the flight
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Adela: you should really not do it, it’s not good for you and your health
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Jhyan: Do you go straight through or do a layover
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Adela: try something else, like drawing or something or something that’s similar, but don’t hurt yourself... please
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Jhyan: I do those
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Adela: 2 hours to madrid for a 5 hour layover and then 10 hours to home
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Adela: layover*
2017/12/25, 15:44 - Jhyan: Ohhh nooo
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Adela: yeah good. don’t cut please
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: That's making my insides hurry
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: *hurt
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: Gah
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: 5 hours
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: Well
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: Ours was 12
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Adela: yup. hopefuly there’s wifi at the airport though. otherwise it’s going to be a very boring 5 hours
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: I'm reading this old nursery rhyme book
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Adela: damn. half a day?
2017/12/25, 15:45 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 15:46 - Jhyan: It was so shit

2017/12/25, 15:46 - Jhyan: Lol you said or something twice
2017/12/25, 15:46 - Adela: i did a really long layover in abu dhabi, but they had some computer thing to play games on

2017/12/25, 15:47 - Jhyan: Give me more details
2017/12/25, 15:47 - Adela: yeah “or something” is my thing
2017/12/25, 15:47 - Jhyan: That sounds interesting
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Adela: it was quite. it was just this screen that you had this like rolling ball which moved the cursor and then you could access the internet and stuff
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Adela: i played some adventure game
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Jhyan: The Qatar airport let you use your ticket number and name as a password and username
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I saw those in Qatar
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Jhyan: I probably know it
2017/12/25, 15:48 - Jhyan: What was it like?
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Adela: ahhh that’s cool. i have airport wifi rn and it’s pretty good
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Adela: i think it was called red ball or something
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Jhyan: Oh
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Adela: i was flying with Qatar
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Jhyan: That's not an adventure game
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Adela: i think we’re talking about the same place
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Jhyan: Oh lol
2017/12/25, 15:49 - Jhyan: That's cool
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Jhyan: Yeah there was that weird jungle Jim next to it
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Jhyan: And a giant bear
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Adela: i didn’t see that,
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Adela: i was there in 2013, i think
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Adela: on my way back from greece
2017/12/25, 15:50 - Jhyan: Oh
2017/12/25, 15:51 - Jhyan: Which island did you go to?
2017/12/25, 15:51 - Jhyan: In Greece
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Adela: i went to athens mainly, but one of the days, i did a 3 island tour - parros, hydra and aegina.
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Adela: hydra was my favourite one
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Jhyan: Athens was the best part
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Jhyan: For me
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Jhyan: Damn I can't remember which one I went to
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Adela: the water was like this infinite dark blue colour and i jumped into it from some 3 metre high thing and it was the most amazing thing
2017/12/25, 15:52 - Adela: you’ve ever been?
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Jhyan: I went there this year
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Adela: athens was really nice, i did some turkey-greece trip, and really enjoyed istanbul
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Adela: ahhh that’s so cool. it’s really beautiful there
2017/12/25, 15:53 - Jhyan: Did you go to the places

2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Adela: did you take those pictures?
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: They were smart
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: The Greeks were like so good
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Adela: yoh they’re really good. do you like photography?
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: They were like the best
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 16:03 - Jhyan: I'm good at photography
2017/12/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: I have more pictures
2017/12/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: That I took
2017/12/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: Like not in Greece
2017/12/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: I'll send them something
2017/12/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: *sometime
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Adela: okay cool that would be nice
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Adela: they were the gods of architecture and design
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: They invented a plumbing system, had great philosophy, civilization ideas, lots of math stuff, etc
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: Not just that
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Adela: they were also so ahead of us mentally. like a greek came up with what makes a good person, before no one used to think of such
2017/12/25, 16:06 - Adela: i was talking about almost the same thing
2017/12/25, 16:07 - Jhyan: Though Arabic and (either Chinese or Japanese) people had the same mathematic ideas
2017/12/25, 16:07 - Jhyan: At around the same time
2017/12/25, 16:07 - Jhyan: Then Pythagoras gets all the credit lol
2017/12/25, 16:07 - Adela: yup, arabics were very advanced with their ideas and maths and stuff
2017/12/25, 16:08 - Adela: but like the greeks had pythagoras and such
2017/12/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: But they did have a lot of original, better ones
2017/12/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: I would say Arabics were better at architecture
2017/12/25, 16:08 - Adela: mmh that is true.
2017/12/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: They designed basically the whole city of Timbuktu
2017/12/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: If that's the city name
2017/12/25, 16:10 - Jhyan: SHIT I FORGOT THEY MADE A MECHANICAL COMPUTER THAT PREDICTS THE NEXT ECLIPSE
2017/12/25, 16:10 - Jhyan: The Greeks
2017/12/25, 16:12 - Jhyan: Oh yeah they had the idea of a spherical earth
2017/12/25, 16:12 - Jhyan: And had the first democracy
2017/12/25, 16:13 - Jhyan: Their fucking theatre used sound engineering
2017/12/25, 16:14 - Adela: yup, there are architectural geniuses all over the world though. in barcelona, there was this architect, Gaudi, who made work so different to the others at his time. he made such beautiful buildings that still look out of place today, like he was from another world entirely
2017/12/25, 16:14 - Jhyan: Lemme search him up
2017/12/25, 16:15 - Jhyan: Yeah cool
2017/12/25, 16:19 - Jhyan: When do you leave to Madrid?
2017/12/25, 16:21 - Adela: i leave at like 5, i think
2017/12/25, 16:21 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2017/12/25, 16:21 - Jhyan: Why did you go to the airport so early
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: but i still need to go through all those other things
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: like baggage checks
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: we returned the keys to our apartment
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: so there was nowhere to go
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Jhyan: Oh shame
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Jhyan: How's it like sitting in that airport?
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: and there’s more to do here
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: yeah i was having hot chocolate and churros
2017/12/25, 16:22 - Adela: the hot chocolate is like pudding
2017/12/25, 16:23 - Jhyan: Wdym
2017/12/25, 16:23 - Jhyan: Oh man let it snow is playing
2017/12/25, 16:23 - Jhyan: It's so cliché
2017/12/25, 16:28 - Adela: i like “last christmas” by wham
2017/12/25, 16:28 - Adela: except george michael actually died last christmas. rip
2017/12/25, 16:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 16:28 - Jhyan: That was playing too!!
2017/12/25, 16:28 - Jhyan: It's a nightmare
2017/12/25, 16:29 - Jhyan: They did turn it off now actually
2017/12/25, 16:29 - Jhyan: Like one minute ago
2017/12/25, 16:34 - Adela: heh, i’m guessing you don’t like christmas jams

2017/12/25, 20:17 - Jhyan: Easily
2017/12/25, 20:17 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/12/25, 20:18 - Jhyan: I did some Über trick in a game once that was so amazing
2017/12/25, 20:18 - Jhyan: And my friends were like how TF did you do that?
2017/12/25, 20:18 - Jhyan: And I was like "easily"
2017/12/25, 20:19 - Jhyan: Because it's such a great thing to say in that situation coz you don't have an exact explanation and you also make them more jealous with a vague answer and an answer that implies it didn't take skill
2017/12/25, 20:19 - Jhyan: And now I just say that for everything
2017/12/25, 21:55 - Adela: yup, the bestest. it feels nice to be able to do things that lots of people can’t and then people look at you in awe and stuffs
2017/12/25, 21:55 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/25, 21:56 - Jhyan: It's only 9 for you

2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: But I have to watch the new STAR WARS
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: I'm gonna watch it today
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: It's the last day it's in cinemas
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Adela: ooh my dad wants to watch that
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Adela: what?
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: Yes
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: Today
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: You have to hurry
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: Watch it with your dad
2017/12/28, 15:40 - Jhyan: If you want
2017/12/28, 15:42 - Jhyan: Actually have you seen it already?
2017/12/28, 17:47 - Adela: nope, i haven’t.
2017/12/28, 17:48 - Adela: how can today be the last day? i’m sure that’s not possible, it only started playing a few weeks ago
2017/12/28, 17:57 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/12/28, 17:57 - Jhyan: That's how it goes
2017/12/28, 17:57 - Jhyan: It's been like a month
2017/12/28, 17:57 - Jhyan: You can watch it online
2017/12/28, 17:58 - Jhyan: Yoh I almost couldn't go
2017/12/28, 19:50 - Jhyan: Well...
2017/12/28, 19:50 - Jhyan: It happened
2017/12/28, 19:51 - Jhyan: The good thing is gone
2017/12/28, 19:51 - Jhyan: Not forever, not yet
2017/12/28, 19:51 - Jhyan: There's a chance I can save it
2017/12/28, 21:54 - Adela: what is it?!
2017/12/28, 21:54 - Adela: omg i need to watch thor
2017/12/28, 23:52 - Jhyan: Hey
2017/12/28, 23:52 - Jhyan: You're online
2017/12/28, 23:53 - Jhyan: I just watched it
2017/12/28, 23:53 - Jhyan: It's amazing
2017/12/28, 23:53 - Jhyan: Thor is good
2017/12/28, 23:53 - Jhyan: Brb
2017/12/28, 23:53 - Adela: omg i’m so jealous
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Adela: indeed i am
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Jhyan: Hold on there might be hope for you yet
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Jhyan: Lemme check
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Jhyan: Aww man
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Jhyan: Sorry to get your hopes up
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Adela: i need to watch that movie
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Adela: i’d watch it on boxoffice
2017/12/28, 23:54 - Jhyan: It ends on the 28th for everything, not just IMAX
2017/12/28, 23:55 - Jhyan: But...?
2017/12/28, 23:59 - Jhyan: Will you judge me if I tell you?
2017/12/29, 01:56 - Adela: of course not
2017/12/29, 01:56 - Adela: damn
2017/12/29, 01:56 - Adela: no but’s
2017/12/29, 09:31 - Jhyan: It's a person
2017/12/29, 09:38 - Jhyan: They were all I had left to lose
2017/12/29, 09:42 - Jhyan: Ok I think I can trust you with knowing the plan
2017/12/29, 09:43 - Jhyan: So first I start a business
2017/12/29, 09:43 - Jhyan: It grows successful
2017/12/29, 09:43 - Jhyan: If it doesn't I'll try again
2017/12/29, 09:43 - Jhyan: But anyway
2017/12/29, 09:43 - Jhyan: I have a nice medium sized business
2017/12/29, 09:44 - Jhyan: Then I expand it
2017/12/29, 09:44 - Jhyan: I research science, break it's limits etc
2017/12/29, 09:44 - Jhyan: I make tech for militaries, people, anyone
2017/12/29, 09:45 - Jhyan: Like different stuff for different types of consumers
2017/12/29, 09:46 - Jhyan: After that I continue doing that, all the while starting secret projects
2017/12/29, 09:46 - Jhyan: One is cloning
2017/12/29, 09:47 - Jhyan: Another are neural technology – things that let you suppress certain emotions or see through people's minds, something like that
2017/12/29, 09:47 - Jhyan: A BUNCH of illegal bioweapons that they can't fight against
2017/12/29, 09:48 - Jhyan: All bioweapons are illegal because of treaties in the past
2017/12/29, 09:48 - Jhyan: The last is power armour
2017/12/29, 09:48 - Jhyan: I'm rich enough to conceal all of this
2017/12/29, 09:49 - Jhyan: Eventually, when it's all done, considering I'm going with the WWIII strategy, I'll do exactly that, after becoming president of either the USA or Russia
2017/12/29, 09:50 - Jhyan: Russia has potential because they already tolerate these controversial experiments and such
2017/12/29, 09:50 - Jhyan: And also they could be manipulated because I can give the promise to restore them to the glorious powerful nation it once was
2017/12/29, 09:50 - Jhyan: Plus they have like a ton of nukes
2017/12/29, 09:51 - Jhyan: Anyway so then I take control of the USA, then from there all the most powerful countries: China, Germany, the UK, etc.
2017/12/29, 09:51 - Jhyan: Then I take the rest of the world
2017/12/29, 09:52 - Jhyan: Ok now before I continue I'll give the other two options
2017/12/29, 09:52 - Jhyan: There's the stealth strategy
2017/12/29, 09:52 - Jhyan: Where all I do is create a secret society type of thing and place agents all through strategic political places throughout the world
2017/12/29, 09:53 - Jhyan: Then I order them to do certain actions that cripple their respective country
2017/12/29, 09:53 - Jhyan: And then I don't need a war to take over them
2017/12/29, 09:53 - Jhyan: Now there's one more
2017/12/29, 09:53 - Jhyan: The cyber strategy
2017/12/29, 09:54 - Jhyan: I act like a cyber terrorist, telling people about my economic system, my better ideas than the evil capitalistic ideologies
2017/12/29, 09:54 - Jhyan: Some won't be persuaded
2017/12/29, 09:54 - Jhyan: But the lower ones will start to hate the governments
2017/12/29, 09:55 - Jhyan: I will have the power of the people
2017/12/29, 09:56 - Jhyan: But, I act like a president who hates this until I "decide" that it's a better system, and split from the government, creating my own forces
2017/12/29, 09:56 - Jhyan: And then the wars are easier seeing as a huge amount of people agree with my side
2017/12/29, 09:57 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I forgot to mention that one of the secret projects is immortality, at least from age
2017/12/29, 09:58 - Jhyan: When I run for president I'll use social engineering to win
2017/12/29, 09:58 - Jhyan: And pay off people if I have to to influence the votes
2017/12/29, 09:59 - Jhyan: Anyway so after I've taken the world, I start the galactic colonization program
2017/12/29, 09:59 - Jhyan: I send self-replicating robots into the stars
2017/12/29, 09:59 - Jhyan: They land on planets, mine resources, create more robots etc
2017/12/29, 10:00 - Jhyan: Anyway they have every kind of way to communicate to alien civilizations information about what we are and things like that
2017/12/29, 10:01 - Jhyan: When this is done (it takes about a million years) we'll have spread throughout a few solar systems
2017/12/29, 10:02 - Jhyan: And I would've put my economic system in place, I'll explain it later
2017/12/29, 10:03 - Jhyan: Anyway so I've developed technology for getting to places better, stasis, wormholes, something like that
2017/12/29, 10:03 - Jhyan: So we can inhabit the whole Galaxy, and more
2017/12/29, 10:04 - Jhyan: My economic system is called the Rewardist system
2017/12/29, 10:04 - Jhyan: Basically there's no money
2017/12/29, 10:05 - Jhyan: You get paid for how much you contribute to the survival and progress of both the immediate and the whole of humanity
2017/12/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: But you get paid in points
2017/12/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: Those points are a status, to tell how valuable they are too society as they are then
2017/12/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: *to
2017/12/29, 10:07 - Jhyan: And they can use those points as slots for luxuries
2017/12/29, 10:08 - Jhyan: Basic food requirements, water, oxygen, anything essential to the life and happiness of the people is given to them with no charge
2017/12/29, 10:09 - Jhyan: If they want a game system they need to take up say 5 points, out of the 20 they have
2017/12/29, 10:09 - Jhyan: Then they want sushi, so that takes 3 points
2017/12/29, 10:09 - Jhyan: Now they have 12 left
2017/12/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: But they want a bigger house now, so they give away the sushi, having 15 and get the house for 14
2017/12/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: So they have 1 free point
2017/12/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: That's how it works
2017/12/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: Everything is supplied by the government, which are all clones of me
2017/12/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: Like the army
2017/12/29, 10:12 - Jhyan: I have a neural chip that inhibits wants like friends or romantic relationships, and that enhances my intelligence so that I can see through the minds of all the different governmental officials on control of all the sectors of the occupied space
2017/12/29, 10:12 - Jhyan: And I can control them when I need to
2017/12/29, 10:13 - Jhyan: Anyway so they all have power armour, and the neural chips suppress things they don't need and enhances things that are helpful
2017/12/29, 10:14 - Jhyan: If an alien race resists my control with a war after I've instilled it they immediately get their capital planet destroyed
2017/12/29, 10:15 - Jhyan: Strike two gets their extinction
2017/12/29, 10:15 - Jhyan: Same with different sectors of humans
2017/12/29, 10:16 - Jhyan: During a war, the ones forced to fight will only be subdued and relocated, so if there's two wars they still have a few members left
2017/12/29, 10:17 - Jhyan: I forgot to mention at the start of my control all the people useless or detrimental to society are killed
2017/12/29, 10:17 - Jhyan: Like people carrying the down syndrome gene
2017/12/29, 10:17 - Jhyan: (but only if there's no cure)
2017/12/29, 10:18 - Jhyan: For example, a person with no legs will be given bionic ones
2017/12/29, 10:18 - Jhyan: Or brown ones
2017/12/29, 10:18 - Jhyan: *grown
2017/12/29, 10:19 - Jhyan: Well I hope you had your notifications off
2017/12/29, 10:19 - Jhyan: There's not much more to say about it
2017/12/29, 12:35 - Adela: damn that’s a reallly long strategy
2017/12/29, 12:35 - Adela: you really thought through it
2017/12/29, 12:36 - Adela: the sound is off, so i don’t get alerted but my screen lights up
2017/12/29, 12:40 - Jhyan: Why do I have to be a mastermind? Why can't I just be smart and likeable Instead of this super genius who is always the villain, the one that loses in the end?
2017/12/29, 12:43 - Jhyan: Well now you know it
2017/12/29, 12:44 - Jhyan: It's evil from most people's perspectives
2017/12/29, 12:44 - Jhyan: But to me, it's the best thing that can ever happen because if I succeed there will literally be no problems left
2017/12/29, 12:55 - Jhyan: Sorry I'm just kinda micro panicking from what happened
2017/12/29, 14:49 - Adela: mmmh that is understandable
2017/12/29, 14:49 - Adela: you don’t have to be the villain tho
2017/12/29, 15:12 - Jhyan: Everyone who knows me properly sees it like that eventually
2017/12/29, 15:17 - Jhyan: And, by my predictions, eventually you'll realize too that I'm a waste of time, that all I do is drag you down, anything that has to do with me being bad
2017/12/29, 15:18 - Jhyan: I am clutching onto a fibre of hope that they are wrong this time
2017/12/29, 17:46 - Adela: i don’t think you’d be that bad.
2017/12/29, 17:47 - Jhyan: Thank you
2017/12/29, 17:47 - Jhyan: But idk
2017/12/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: Which one looks better
2017/12/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: I'll send the pictures now
2017/12/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/12/29, 20:23 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/12/29, 20:32 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/12/29, 20:34 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/12/29, 23:15 - Jhyan: Good night
2017/12/29, 23:59 - Adela: the second one
2017/12/29, 23:59 - Adela: sorry i was watching star wars
2017/12/30, 08:46 - Jhyan: Cool
2017/12/30, 08:47 - Jhyan: How was it?
2017/12/30, 09:17 - Jhyan: Yoh I am witnessing a bug being killed by a colony of ants
2017/12/30, 09:17 - Jhyan: It's kinda horrifying
2017/12/30, 10:00 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/12/30, 13:27 - Jhyan: So one of my ideas for stuff I'm gonna invent is a way to transport power: heat
2017/12/30, 13:28 - Jhyan: You have cables transport heat and don't let it out and then it gets translated to electricity at the other end if it even needs that
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Adela: sorry i was cutting my hairrr
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Adela: it was really good, it kinda dragged on because it was really really long
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Jhyan: Woah
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Jhyan: How different is it
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Jhyan: Or did you just trim it
2017/12/30, 13:38 - Jhyan: I didn't find it very long
2017/12/30, 13:39 - Adela: damn i wish i had ideas like you
2017/12/30, 13:39 - Adela: i absolutely loved ren and ray’s connection, i want them to end up being together
2017/12/30, 13:39 - Adela: it’s like shoulder length now
2017/12/30, 13:39 - Jhyan: Yeah ikr
2017/12/30, 13:39 - Jhyan: Like Ren clearly wasn't meaning to be on the dark side
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Jhyan: They could've both been grey Jedi
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Adela: he wasn’t!
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Jhyan: And I agreed that they should let go of the past
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Adela: he’s my favourite character because he has such a hectic story and there is good in him but it’s overpowered by this insane darkness
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Adela: omg i did too!
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Adela: i would have honestly taken his hand and joined him to end the jedi
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Jhyan: I also don't like that they didn't do anything with The Knights of Ren
2017/12/30, 13:40 - Jhyan: They mentioned it in episode 7
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Jhyan: The dark side isn't actually evil
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Adela: which one was that?
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Adela: i’m not a huge fan of star wars
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Jhyan: It's literally just offensive and defensive instead of just defensive like the Jedi
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Adela: i just like some of the movies
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Jhyan: Well at least from my perspective
2017/12/30, 13:41 - Adela: yeah it isn’t. i’m actually more towards the dark side
2017/12/30, 13:42 - Jhyan: The first one with Rey
2017/12/30, 13:42 - Jhyan: The first order is doing it wrong though, the empire was better
2017/12/30, 13:42 - Jhyan: Also
2017/12/30, 13:42 - Jhyan: The empire was a fucking normal government
2017/12/30, 13:42 - Jhyan: There was nothing evil about them
2017/12/30, 13:43 - Jhyan: Sure they killed rebels but they were ACTUALLY terrorists
2017/12/30, 13:43 - Jhyan: Anyway
2017/12/30, 13:43 - Jhyan: I just hope they end it on episode 9 because they're gonna milk it so hard otherwise
2017/12/30, 13:43 - Adela: ohhh i wasn’t paying good attention in that movie
2017/12/30, 13:44 - Jhyan: Yeah basically they're like an elite team under his command
2017/12/30, 13:44 - Adela: mmh i feel. i feel like the star wars series kinda need to face its end
2017/12/30, 13:44 - Adela: because they can’t have 20 episodes
2017/12/30, 13:44 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/12/30, 13:44 - Jhyan: Lol there was this really bad book set in the future that I had to read in grade 6
2017/12/30, 13:45 - Adela: ahhh what was it called?
2017/12/30, 13:45 - Jhyan: And the guy was watching STAR WARS episode 50 or something like that
2017/12/30, 13:45 - Jhyan: Idk
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: 7.6/10
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Adela: eh wtf
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: Ikr
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: It's not even a funny joke
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: It's just cheap
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Adela: have you ever watched “predestination”
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: So Wyd now
2017/12/30, 13:46 - Jhyan: Yes
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: that’s just shiit
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: What was it about again
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: i’m waiting for my dad because he’s also cutting his hair
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: There was this one time I watched a bunch of time travel stuff
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: some guy who can time travel
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: To see how it compared
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: it’s really hectic
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: So I can't remember which is which
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: it was a good story
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: a bit confusing though
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: Does it have telekinetic people
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Adela: he went forward in time to meet himself
2017/12/30, 13:47 - Jhyan: Oh nvm
2017/12/30, 13:48 - Jhyan: Hold on lemme check
2017/12/30, 13:48 - Adela: he was a girl but then he became a man and then went to the past to be with the female version of himself
2017/12/30, 13:49 - Jhyan: Wait
2017/12/30, 13:49 - Jhyan: For some reason I haven't watched it
2017/12/30, 13:49 - Jhyan: _*A temporal agent (Ethan Hawke) embarks on a final time-traveling assignment to prevent an elusive criminal from launching an attack that kills thousands of people."_
2017/12/30, 13:50 - Jhyan: Or else you're talking about something else
2017/12/30, 13:51 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2017/12/30, 13:51 - Jhyan: I haven't watched it
2017/12/30, 13:51 - Jhyan: Dammit I was supposed to
2017/12/30, 13:52 - Adela: you should watch it!
2017/12/30, 13:52 - Adela: it’s on netflix, it’s pretty good. my dad absolutely loved it and he has better movie taste than me
2017/12/30, 13:52 - Jhyan: Yeah I will
2017/12/30, 13:52 - Jhyan: Damn and Black Mirror season 4
2017/12/30, 13:53 - Jhyan: What's your movie taste like?
2017/12/30, 13:53 - Jhyan: Have you seen Black Mirror?
2017/12/30, 13:58 - Jhyan: Ok see you later I'm gonna be busy
2017/12/30, 14:00 - Adela: my cousin told me to watch it, but i need to actually start
2017/12/30, 14:00 - Adela: uhm i either like family friendly movies like “finding nemo” when i don’t want to think much, i like psychological thrillers, movies that make you think, and stuff
2017/12/30, 18:53 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2017/12/30, 18:53 - Jhyan: I guess Black Mirror is like a psychological thriller
2017/12/30, 18:53 - Jhyan: And it makes you think AF
2017/12/30, 18:53 - Jhyan: No it's more like a psychological horror
2017/12/30, 18:53 - Jhyan: But it's not a horror
2017/12/30, 18:54 - Jhyan: Idk you must watch it
2017/12/30, 18:54 - Jhyan: It's like really dark
2017/12/30, 18:54 - Jhyan: A lot of the episodes
2017/12/30, 18:54 - Adela: ahhh that’s pretty cooll
2017/12/30, 18:55 - Adela: i guess i will hey
2017/12/30, 18:55 - Jhyan: And it doesn't really require commitment because it has self contained episodic storylines
2017/12/30, 18:55 - Jhyan: So what did you do anything different with your hair earlier?
2017/12/30, 18:56 - Jhyan: *no what
2017/12/30, 18:56 - Jhyan: Brb
2017/12/30, 18:56 - Adela: it’s like shoulder length
2017/12/30, 18:56 - Adela: oh goddamn

2017/12/30, 18:57 - Jhyan: Woah that'll look nice
2017/12/30, 18:59 - Adela: lol thank youu
2017/12/30, 18:59 - Adela: it was a big change and i was so scared to do it
2017/12/30, 18:59 - Adela: but it’s done now so yay
2017/12/30, 18:59 - Jhyan: Do you like it?
2017/12/30, 19:03 - Adela: yeah i do actually
2017/12/30, 19:59 - Jhyan: Hey I want to thank you for always being nice and for trying your best to support me when I'm feeling down
2017/12/30, 20:59 - Adela: you’re welcome, jhyan. it’s always a pleasure
2017/12/30, 20:59 - Adela: i’m just that person i guess

2017/12/30, 23:24 - Jhyan: Yoh
2017/12/30, 23:24 - Jhyan: Why 2 hours extra
2017/12/30, 23:25 - Adela: i normally sleep at 3, so it’s early for me
2017/12/30, 23:25 - Jhyan: My book is almost finished and I'm disappointed
2017/12/30, 23:27 - Jhyan: Oh you're gonna start 2017 with a nice, early bedtime? Are you adding a hint of healthy herbs to your pizza to start with the healthy lifestyle aswell?
2017/12/30, 23:27 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/12/30, 23:27 - Jhyan: Jk
2017/12/30, 23:28 - Jhyan: Did I ever tell you about that one holiday where I became nocturnal?
2017/12/30, 23:29 - Jhyan: Wait let's continue this tomorrow I was almost asleep
2017/12/30, 23:33 - Adela: damn i haven’t finished the first book in this trilogy yet
2017/12/30, 23:34 - Adela: lolol, my sleeping schedule is so fucking weird. and also, i’ve had mcdonald’s twice
2017/12/30, 23:34 - Adela: nono
2017/12/30, 23:34 - Adela: okay sure. good night
2017/12/30, 23:35 - Jhyan: Night
2017/12/31, 11:22 - Jhyan: So it was last December
2017/12/31, 11:22 - Jhyan: I was bored every day
2017/12/31, 11:22 - Jhyan: So I started sleeping late, thinking I'd be awake for less time
2017/12/31, 11:23 - Jhyan: But really I was awake for the same amount of time
2017/12/31, 11:23 - Jhyan: I just slept later and later
2017/12/31, 11:25 - Jhyan: And waking up later and later
2017/12/31, 11:26 - Jhyan: So eventually I started waking up at about 5
2017/12/31, 11:26 - Jhyan: Actually it was like 7 near the end
2017/12/31, 11:27 - Jhyan: And I would sleep at like 4 am
2017/12/31, 11:27 - Jhyan: So I'd wake up and have supper for breakfast
2017/12/31, 16:11 - Adela: damn
2017/12/31, 16:11 - Adela: nocturnal animals hey
2018/01/02, 20:20 - Jhyan: Hey I'm back
2018/01/02, 20:20 - Jhyan: I was supposed to have it off for a lot longer
2018/01/02, 20:20 - Jhyan: But I can't even follow my own rules
2018/01/02, 21:55 - Adela: have what off?
2018/01/02, 21:55 - Adela: whoop whoop
2018/01/02, 21:55 - Jhyan: My phone
2018/01/02, 21:55 - Jhyan: You didn't get the message?
2018/01/02, 21:55 - Jhyan: Doesn't matter
2018/01/02, 21:56 - Jhyan: I'm playing The Witcher III
2018/01/02, 21:56 - Jhyan: It's really good
2018/01/02, 21:56 - Jhyan: Lol I finished downloading it as we left
2018/01/02, 21:56 - Jhyan: And my mom woke up too early so I was supposed to have 1 hour to try it out
2018/01/02, 21:57 - Jhyan: But instead we left
2018/01/02, 22:05 - Jhyan: So what have you been up to?
2018/01/02, 22:12 - Adela: nahh i didn’t get that message.
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Jhyan: Weird
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Adela: i’ve been packing because i’m going to cape town tomorrow, and basically chilling and watching “that 70’s show” a whole lot
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Adela: what have you been doing?
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Adela: oh yes, i’ve also been watching star wars
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Jhyan: Yoh but you only have until like the 14th
2018/01/02, 22:13 - Jhyan: All of them!?!??
2018/01/02, 22:14 - Jhyan: Thinking, partly punishing myself for making such a stupid action, mostly feeling anxious
2018/01/02, 22:14 - Jhyan: Don't worry the punishment was just not using my phone
2018/01/02, 22:15 - Jhyan: Anyway I need to make things right tomorrow
2018/01/02, 22:15 - Jhyan: I got home, that major detail slipped my mind
2018/01/02, 22:15 - Jhyan: Well I guess you figured
2018/01/02, 22:17 - Adela: yeah i’m coming back on the 9th

2018/01/02, 22:20 - Adela: my dad suggested i watch 1-3 because i’d enjoy it more
2018/01/02, 22:21 - Jhyan: No
2018/01/02, 22:21 - Jhyan: I just died
2018/01/02, 22:21 - Jhyan: Ghjgghhgf
2018/01/02, 22:21 - Jhyan: *dying noises*
2018/01/02, 22:22 - Jhyan: Ok whatever

2018/01/02, 22:23 - Adela: thank youuu
2018/01/02, 22:23 - Adela: lol
2018/01/02, 22:23 - Adela: don’t die though

2018/01/02, 22:34 - Adela: yoyo
2018/01/02, 22:34 - Adela: if you say so
2018/01/03, 09:45 - Jhyan: So are you doing a roadtrip
2018/01/03, 10:31 - Adela: nah i’m flying in like an hour
2018/01/03, 10:32 - Jhyan: Dammit
2018/01/03, 10:32 - Jhyan: Every time
2018/01/03, 10:32 - Jhyan: Everyone else always flies
2018/01/03, 10:40 - Adela: do you normally do road trips?
2018/01/03, 10:40 - Jhyan: Every time 🤪
2018/01/03, 11:06 - Adela: well isn’t that just dandy,
2018/01/03, 11:06 - Adela: i like roadtrips though, they’re pretty great. also, i get to play the music so that makes it more enjoyable
2018/01/03, 12:06 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/01/03, 12:06 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/01/03, 12:07 - Jhyan: So you're there now?
2018/01/03, 13:37 - Adela: yup i’m in cpt
2018/01/03, 13:37 - Adela: the plane was so cold oml
2018/01/03, 13:38 - Jhyan: I hate when that happens
2018/01/03, 13:38 - Jhyan: And you don't have a jacket
2018/01/04, 00:22 - Adela: yes that happened today
2018/01/04, 00:22 - Adela: i was freezing to death
2018/01/04, 00:22 - Jhyan: Hehe
2018/01/04, 00:22 - Adela: i was sleeping with my hands in my t-shirt
2018/01/04, 00:22 - Adela: like i didn’t have then through the sleeves
2018/01/04, 00:23 - Jhyan: But it's not as bad as your mom forcing you to take the only comfortable jacket you have (meant for like the Arctic or something)
2018/01/04, 00:24 - Jhyan: And then the airport is hot, you have to run everywhere with a heavy bag, you haven't been recommended to yet that women's deodorant works better, the aeroplane is normal, Qatar weather (no explanation needed), more airport, more aeroplane, Greece weather, airport
2018/01/04, 00:25 - Jhyan: Hehe
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Jhyan: So why are you up so late
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Adela: dammit that pretty much sucks.
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Adela: sometimes i don’t bring a jacket just because i hate lugging it around
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Jhyan: Don't judge me for using women's deodorant on especially hot days also
2018/01/04, 00:30 - Adela: oh i normally sleep around this time (mainly later), also i was up late talking with my family
2018/01/04, 00:31 - Jhyan: Woah wait that might sound serious due to my actual sensitivity. I'm jk
2018/01/04, 00:34 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 00:34 - Jhyan: *Thug Life
2018/01/04, 00:35 - Jhyan: Yoh ok I need to sleep though because I'm going to Macro early tomorrow and also I need my full personality for something later
2018/01/04, 00:35 - Jhyan: And I need to pick computers there so I need to be able to think properly
2018/01/04, 00:36 - Jhyan: Enjoy the rest of _your_ evening
2018/01/04, 00:36 - Jhyan: Because for me it's my late night
2018/01/04, 00:41 - Adela: nah don’t stress
2018/01/04, 00:41 - Adela: oooh whats the something later
2018/01/04, 00:41 - Adela: thank you thank you
2018/01/04, 00:42 - Jhyan: Ooh I'll tell you tomorrow after it happens if it goes wrong
2018/01/04, 00:42 - Jhyan: K bai
2018/01/04, 00:42 - Jhyan: Actually also if it goes right
2018/01/04, 00:43 - Jhyan: K bai #2
2018/01/04, 00:53 - Adela: okay then. can’t wait to find out
2018/01/04, 09:37 - Jhyan: So there's always this sale
2018/01/04, 09:37 - Jhyan: On the game store
2018/01/04, 09:37 - Jhyan: It's called Steam
2018/01/04, 09:38 - Jhyan: Like around Christmas
2018/01/04, 09:38 - Jhyan: I bought a bunch of games
2018/01/04, 09:40 - Jhyan: Yoh I must be really bored rn to be telling this random shit
2018/01/04, 09:41 - Jhyan: Actually don't you have to wake up early now
2018/01/04, 09:42 - Jhyan: How does your late-night-late-morning routine go
2018/01/04, 11:51 - Jhyan: Ok if it goes wrong I think we should stop talking for a little bit because I might say stuff without thinking or something
2018/01/04, 11:51 - Jhyan: Sorry
2018/01/04, 14:48 - Jhyan: My sister got an infection so I have to do the thing tomorrow
2018/01/04, 16:18 - Jhyan: Um if you're ever uncomfortable with something I say just tell me
2018/01/04, 18:31 - Adela: ahh don’t say that
2018/01/04, 18:31 - Jhyan: Ok I'll see how I feel
2018/01/04, 18:31 - Adela: i go to bed late and wake up early then i eat and realise “oh wait, i’m still tired” and then i go to sleep until 12
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Adela: nah i’m not, don’t worry
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Jhyan: 🤦🏻‍♂
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Jhyan: Yeah but in future too
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Adela: okay sure
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Adela: yeah it sucks
2018/01/04, 18:32 - Jhyan: Just hold on I need to show you a video of this one game
2018/01/04, 18:33 - Jhyan: It's really cool
2018/01/04, 18:33 - Jhyan: You'll be like "What..."
2018/01/04, 18:33 - Jhyan: Ok so it's in the future and on an abandoned space station
2018/01/04, 18:35 - Jhyan: It'ss like really story rich and is more of like an interactive book with narration and a world to explore
2018/01/04, 18:35 - Jhyan: Well a station
2018/01/04, 18:37 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 18:39 - Jhyan: Ignore the background audio pls
2018/01/04, 18:40 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 18:42 - Jhyan: I just saw it like as you sent me messages and it's really cool so I sent it
2018/01/04, 18:44 - Jhyan: Woah there's this 0 gravity basketball thing where the room rotates
2018/01/04, 18:44 - Jhyan: And I threw one in (after a few tries) and it gave me an achievement
2018/01/04, 18:53 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 19:47 - Jhyan: How was your day?
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Adela: that looks so cool
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Adela: the whole game thingy looks quite awesome actuallu
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Adela: actually*
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Adela: i like interactive programs and stuff
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Jhyan: Yeah but an even better thing is the AR playback
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Jhyan: You can see people in the past
2018/01/04, 20:24 - Jhyan: Because it was recording what they did and their voices
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Adela: it was great. i went to my grandfather’s house and we’re not close and he has another wife who everyone doesn’t like because he cheated on my granny with her. i was there for 2 hours and hated it, but now i’m at my aunt’s house so i feel better and i had nice food so
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Jhyan: Lemme show you when I'm done with this one
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Adela: ah that’s pretty cool
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Adela: okie dokie
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2018/01/04, 20:25 - Jhyan: And you'll understand why it took so long sorry
2018/01/04, 20:26 - Jhyan: *also
2018/01/04, 21:03 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 21:04 - Jhyan: So you can see that you have to play it multiple times in each room with a person to hear their specific dialogue, and those markers on the bottom indicate when the crew open their AR desktop (I opened the purple one, with the documents)
2018/01/04, 21:08 - Jhyan: And on top of that, you have to take it in and understand what happened, while enjoying the extra stuff like the report and desktops
2018/01/04, 21:19 - Jhyan: Omfg there's a pool table and you can actually play
2018/01/04, 21:19 - Jhyan: Also there's a lot of extra stuff
2018/01/04, 21:20 - Jhyan: They had that short Ts&Cs thing before you signed in and a medicine box with all the little details
2018/01/04, 21:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 21:23 - Jhyan: Like they go in their specific places in the triangle
2018/01/04, 21:24 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/04, 21:42 - Jhyan: Ok so like in this other playback thing there's like a more closed room speed
2018/01/04, 21:42 - Jhyan: *space
2018/01/04, 21:42 - Jhyan: And the first one I did was the red and orange people
2018/01/04, 21:43 - Jhyan: And at one point the red one calls the purple one
2018/01/04, 21:45 - Jhyan: And then I replayed it after it finished, but where the green person was, and he was on a call with his son, and the blue person walks in (a doctor) and his son wanted to know about radiation on the station, and at this point you can see the purple one walking to the red one through his room window, and when the doctor first came through, she was already talking to the AI
2018/01/04, 21:45 - Jhyan: It's all simultaneously happening and it's really cool
2018/01/04, 21:46 - Jhyan: Also you can punch the punching bag
2018/01/04, 22:01 - Jhyan: Woah this magazine references Google and Elon Musk (who apparently became president)
2018/01/04, 22:58 - Adela: woah that sounds pretty futuristic
2018/01/04, 22:58 - Adela: i really like the sound of the game
2018/01/04, 22:58 - Adela: wait, what was the good thing happened to you?
2018/01/04, 22:59 - Jhyan: Didn't I tell you already
2018/01/04, 22:59 - Jhyan: Are we talking about what was supposed to happen today
2018/01/04, 23:00 - Jhyan: Like what I said before it's basically literature with advanced storytelling
2018/01/04, 23:01 - Jhyan: Especially the way the conversations are connected
2018/01/04, 23:01 - Jhyan: Most games aren't as story rich
2018/01/04, 23:16 - Adela: yes
2018/01/04, 23:16 - Adela: no you didn’t
2018/01/04, 23:17 - Jhyan: I did
2018/01/04, 23:17 - Adela: yeah that’s true
2018/01/04, 23:17 - Jhyan: I'll find it for you
2018/01/04, 23:17 - Adela: okay, because i don’t remember
2018/01/04, 23:17 - Jhyan: Here
2018/01/04, 23:18 - Adela: who is this person? do i know him/her?
2018/01/04, 23:18 - Jhyan: Maybe
2018/01/04, 23:21 - Jhyan: The thing that's supposed to happen is a phonecall to fix something that happened
2018/01/04, 23:22 - Jhyan: That's why I might've lost them
2018/01/04, 23:22 - Jhyan: And might be able to save it
2018/01/04, 23:24 - Jhyan: Sorry for uselessly keeping this information from you
2018/01/04, 23:24 - Jhyan: I guess old habits die hard don't they
2018/01/04, 23:47 - Jhyan: Well I'm going to bed now
2018/01/04, 23:48 - Jhyan: Good night Adela
2018/01/04, 23:58 - Adela: yeah they truly do, i have the habit of creating these scenarios and possibilities in my head that are all negative and i just replay them and overthink things and just imagine losing everything all the time, and no matter what i do, i can’t stop it
2018/01/04, 23:58 - Adela: good night jhyan
2018/01/04, 23:58 - Adela: did it not happen?
2018/01/04, 23:58 - Jhyan: Similar
2018/01/04, 23:59 - Jhyan: Yeah my sister got an infection so I had to delay it to tomorrow
2018/01/04, 23:59 - Jhyan: Ok see you tomorrow
2018/01/05, 00:00 - Adela: oh no. i’m sorry that that happened to your sister
2018/01/05, 00:00 - Adela: cool cool
2018/01/05, 07:52 - Jhyan: It's not that bad it's just a jaw that hurts until it gets better
2018/01/05, 09:46 - Adela: ahh that happened to me when a basketball flew into my face
2018/01/05, 09:46 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/05, 09:46 - Jhyan: ...?
2018/01/05, 10:05 - Adela: yeah it just flew to my chin and i couldn’t chew for a day because it was too painful
2018/01/05, 10:05 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/01/05, 10:51 - Adela: yeah it was the worst
2018/01/05, 10:51 - Jhyan: You know I've never broken a bone
2018/01/05, 10:52 - Jhyan: Or gotten sick enough to have taken antibiotics
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Adela: i’ve never had any bone broken
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Adela: nah that used to be me at least twice a year
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Jhyan: Cool
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Jhyan: Most people have
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Adela: that’s true
2018/01/05, 11:00 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/05, 11:01 - Jhyan: I'm just busy rn ttyl

2018/01/05, 12:10 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/05, 12:10 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>

2018/01/05, 13:08 - Adela: i like the fourth one
2018/01/05, 13:08 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/01/05, 13:09 - Jhyan: I thought that too
2018/01/05, 13:09 - Jhyan: It's cleaner and simpler
2018/01/05, 13:10 - Jhyan: The other ones look weirder because of the added weight of the extra back side
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Adela: oh yay we agreed
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Adela: do you do all of this electronically?
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Jhyan: Digital art
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Jhyan: Ok I'll show you behind the scenes
2018/01/05, 15:28 - Adela: okay sure
2018/01/05, 15:29 - Adela: oh it’s hella cool
2018/01/05, 15:29 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/01/05, 15:29 - Jhyan: This one actually came out better than expected
2018/01/05, 15:31 - Jhyan: Don't expect too much
2018/01/05, 15:42 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/05, 15:42 - Jhyan: Excuse my long nails they're useful so I don't cut them
2018/01/05, 17:15 - Jhyan: What does the Sun look like from where you are now?
2018/01/05, 17:21 - Adela: it looks normal?
2018/01/05, 17:21 - Jhyan: Too late now
2018/01/05, 17:21 - Jhyan: It went behind a cloud
2018/01/05, 17:21 - Adela: ahh that’s so cool
2018/01/05, 17:22 - Jhyan: Woah my WiFi is freaking out
2018/01/05, 17:22 - Jhyan: Sorry
2018/01/05, 17:23 - Jhyan: I'm uploading something
2018/01/05, 17:23 - Jhyan: That's why
2018/01/05, 17:27 - Jhyan: Test
2018/01/05, 17:28 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/01/05, 17:45 - Adela: damn that happens to me all the time
2018/01/05, 17:45 - Adela: sometimes my wifi actually sucks
2018/01/05, 17:45 - Jhyan: Do you know what it's specs are
2018/01/05, 17:45 - Jhyan: Like the supposed speed
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: Mine's 0.25X as fast as the standard
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: Or 0.2X
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: Can't remember
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: It's 4Mbps
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: But the standard is either 20 or 25
2018/01/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: They decreed it in 2015
2018/01/05, 17:47 - Jhyan: It used to be 4
2018/01/05, 17:47 - Jhyan: And I can't even get fibre because my phone is falling apart so I need a new one
2018/01/05, 17:47 - Jhyan: Not because of lack of care but this thing is like 6 years old or something
2018/01/05, 17:48 - Jhyan: Also my mom didn't take care of it properly now that I think about it
2018/01/05, 20:25 - Adela: it’s a fibre line
2018/01/05, 20:25 - Adela: 50 whatever
2018/01/05, 20:25 - Jhyan: ☹
2018/01/05, 20:26 - Jhyan: I'm jelly
2018/01/05, 20:26 - Adela: 50 mbps
2018/01/05, 20:26 - Adela: hehe. it’s very good most of the time but it used to switch of every so now and then
2018/01/05, 21:18 - Jhyan: Sorry
2018/01/05, 21:18 - Jhyan: Ok I'm gonna ask a shitty question
2018/01/05, 21:18 - Jhyan: How much can I trust you?
2018/01/05, 21:58 - Adela: you can trust me quite a bit, i think. it’s completely up to you of course. whatever feels comfortable for you
2018/01/05, 21:59 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/01/05, 21:59 - Jhyan: Oh and also the call got delayed to tomorrow again
2018/01/05, 21:59 - Jhyan: Anyway I was asking because I need to decide what to do if things go wrong
2018/01/05, 23:30 - Adela: what do you mean?
2018/01/06, 08:22 - Jhyan: Like if it goes wrong I won't be able to deal with the pain, so I should decide if I should go with my old plan or make a new one
2018/01/06, 08:23 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/01/06, 10:38 - Jhyan: *them to see

2018/01/06, 22:08 - Adela: what went wrong
2018/01/06, 22:09 - Jhyan: Nothing, I just fucked up like I always do for one, and trusting them bit me hard – with venom
2018/01/06, 22:09 - Jhyan: At least they weren't angry or anything
2018/01/06, 22:10 - Jhyan: What specifically, that message covers too many things to explain
2018/01/06, 22:11 - Jhyan: Wait idk why I said nothing. Of course it went wrong
2018/01/06, 22:19 - Adela: nah don’t worry
2018/01/06, 22:19 - Adela: i’m sorry, that’s never nice
2018/01/06, 22:19 - Jhyan: I just hope I haven't repeated the mistake
2018/01/06, 22:21 - Jhyan: It's not very nice that you go offline after asking me questions about this, especially when I'm willing to trust you after all I've been through.
2018/01/06, 22:22 - Jhyan: Sorry I shouldn't have said that
2018/01/06, 22:22 - Jhyan: You're trying
2018/01/06, 22:22 - Jhyan: I'm gonna sleep now

2018/01/07, 12:33 - Jhyan: My grandfather stole it to fix his glasses

2018/01/07, 12:34 - Adela: ohh for what?

2018/01/07, 12:35 - Jhyan: It's this really bad French one
2018/01/07, 12:35 - Jhyan: And it can't connect to the remote

2018/01/11, 20:28 - Jhyan: idk
2018/01/11, 20:29 - Adela: yes and then they changed things up so horribly
2018/01/11, 20:30 - Jhyan: ikr
2018/01/11, 20:32 - Jhyan: What if they don't let you change?
2018/01/11, 23:33 - Adela: idk why they wouldn’t. it would be totally unfair because so many other people are allowed to
2018/01/11, 23:34 - Jhyan: Really
2018/01/11, 23:34 - Jhyan: How many others are changing?

2018/01/12, 10:31 - Jhyan: Like wtf
2018/01/12, 10:31 - Jhyan: For anything, not just classes

2018/01/13, 18:45 - Jhyan: Also when I say oh
2018/01/13, 21:26 - Adela: yeahhh it’s one of those replies that are hard to reply to
2018/01/13, 21:27 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/13, 21:27 - Jhyan: I hate when I say them though coz it's like boring
2018/01/13, 21:27 - Jhyan: Saying the same things
2018/01/13, 21:29 - Adela: yeah it is
2018/01/13, 21:29 - Adela: being normal is boring
2018/01/13, 21:30 - Jhyan: And it's that feeling you get when you have a bad habit that you don't like
2018/01/13, 21:33 - Jhyan: Wyd
2018/01/13, 21:33 - Adela: yeah that’s me

2018/01/19, 17:52 - Adela: i’m so shocked you remembered the name
2018/01/19, 17:52 - Jhyan: Soz
2018/01/19, 17:52 - Jhyan: Why
2018/01/19, 17:53 - Adela: understandable. i don’t think i would like it, if it hadn’t been in that movie like that
2018/01/19, 17:53 - Adela: idk it was a very long time ago
2018/01/19, 17:53 - Jhyan: Oh my personality type is INTJ if you want to read it

2018/01/22, 21:46 - Jhyan: Wait till you see the second one, 1080p, 60fps, painstakingly hand drawn frames
2018/01/22, 21:48 - Jhyan: I'll also give you a song
2018/01/22, 21:48 - Jhyan: Lanterns on the lake - Through the cellar door

2018/01/22, 21:49 - Adela: i really like it
2018/01/22, 21:49 - Adela: damnnn you guys are incredible
2018/01/22, 21:49 - Jhyan: Yeah but March is probably gonna get scratched out too
2018/01/22, 21:53 - Jhyan: Have you watched The End of The F***ing World?
2018/01/22, 21:53 - Jhyan: It's really good
2018/01/22, 21:53 - Jhyan: I like the song
2018/01/22, 21:59 - Jhyan: Why do you like it?
2018/01/22, 22:46 - Jhyan: I'm gonna sleep
2018/01/23, 05:35 - Adela: oh yes i did
2018/01/23, 05:35 - Adela: just the words. it gets me thinking
2018/01/23, 16:39 - Jhyan: Hey

2018/01/23, 17:04 - Adela: i haven’t listened yet. will listen tonight
2018/01/23, 17:04 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2018/01/23, 17:05 - Jhyan: What's up?
2018/01/23, 18:09 - Adela: just got home from basketball, gonna do some workouts, shower, eat then do homework and fun things
2018/01/23, 18:09 - Adela: what’s good?
2018/01/23, 18:09 - Jhyan: I'm watching a show
2018/01/23, 18:10 - Adela: ohhh which one?
2018/01/23, 18:10 - Jhyan: And I wrote something
2018/01/23, 18:10 - Jhyan: Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency
2018/01/23, 18:11 - Jhyan: How are you on the art Journal thing?
2018/01/24, 13:52 - Adela: haven’t even started
2018/01/24, 13:52 - Adela: ooouu what?
2018/01/24, 13:55 - Jhyan: Aren't you doing maths
2018/01/24, 13:56 - Jhyan: I have been staring at it at home for the last 3 days
2018/01/24, 15:04 - Jhyan: Ok so I started and I think I overdid it
2018/01/24, 19:19 - Adela: lemme see
2018/01/24, 19:21 - Jhyan: I'll show you tomorrow
2018/01/24, 19:21 - Jhyan: It's better in real life isn't it?
2018/01/24, 19:22 - Jhyan: I actually made 3
2018/01/24, 19:22 - Jhyan: Coz I was supposed to start on Monday
2018/01/24, 19:22 - Jhyan: Oh also
2018/01/24, 19:24 - Jhyan: I want to clarify, because sometimes when I don't, people get the wrong information
2018/01/24, 19:25 - Jhyan: And either do things or don't do things based on it
2018/01/24, 19:29 - Jhyan: Just generally, when I'm not really responsive, it's not that I don't like what's happening, I'm just like that, but I usually appreciate interaction
2018/01/24, 20:03 - Adela: yes totally
2018/01/24, 20:04 - Adela: yeah i understand.
2018/01/24, 20:04 - Jhyan: I'm still busy with my third one though
2018/01/24, 20:04 - Adela: i can be really shy and be out of the crowd a lot, but i guess i kinda weave my way in
2018/01/24, 20:04 - Adela: i haven’t even started
2018/01/24, 20:04 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/01/24, 20:05 - Jhyan: It's fine she'll probably let you start tomorrow
2018/01/24, 21:22 - Adela: yeah but we don’t have art tomorrow (if the gala goes according to plan so yay)
2018/01/24, 21:22 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/01/24, 21:23 - Jhyan: I forgot
2018/01/24, 21:23 - Jhyan: So is it only next week then?
2018/01/24, 21:24 - Jhyan: Hey now I'm off the hook for still not doing my maths homework
2018/01/24, 22:10 - Jhyan: Good night
2018/01/25, 05:36 - Adela: whoop whoop
2018/01/25, 05:36 - Adela: well she said we don’t have to staft because she still wants to explain something so
2018/01/25, 05:37 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/01/25, 05:37 - Jhyan: Good morning btw
2018/01/25, 05:37 - Adela: heyy
2018/01/25, 19:12 - Jhyan: Do you know what the HoloLens is
2018/01/25, 19:13 - Jhyan: I didn't think I'd be living in the future
2018/01/25, 19:15 - Jhyan: They're selling it properly now
2018/01/25, 19:15 - Jhyan: Go look at the trailer or a review or something
2018/01/25, 22:20 - Jhyan: Good night
2018/01/26, 05:41 - Adela: nah i don’t
2018/01/26, 05:41 - Adela: okay sure thing.
2018/01/26, 05:41 - Adela: sorry i fell asleep real early, i was super tired
2018/01/26, 05:42 - Jhyan: It's fine you got some energy which is better
2018/01/26, 16:36 - Adela: at least
2018/01/26, 16:36 - Jhyan: Hey
2018/01/26, 16:38 - Adela: hii
2018/01/26, 16:39 - Jhyan: Wanna know something fun for when you're bored
2018/01/26, 16:39 - Jhyan: Ok I'll take that as a yes
2018/01/26, 16:40 - Jhyan: Basically you put two random words (preferably with hard consonants in them) into Google translate with the word "and" in between
2018/01/26, 16:40 - Jhyan: Then you make it longer
2018/01/26, 16:41 - Jhyan: And you can get Google to beatbox for you in different ways
2018/01/26, 18:17 - Jhyan: Woah it's Friday
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Adela: ooooh that’s cool. i’m gonna do that
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Adela: this week was hella fast
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Jhyan: yeah
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Adela: it feels like it’s a wednesday
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Jhyan: It's wierd
2018/01/26, 20:31 - Jhyan: normally
2018/01/26, 20:32 - Jhyan: Normally I'd be waiting for Friday but it just kinda snuck up
2018/01/26, 20:32 - Jhyan: But It's nice tho
2018/01/26, 22:09 - Adela: yeah it went sooo fast
2018/01/26, 22:09 - Adela: i’ve been doing maths since 8/9pm. fun
2018/01/26, 22:09 - Jhyan: Woah
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: Shame
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Adela: yeah so it’s been real eventful
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Adela: but i’m done now
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: I would find that fun though
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Adela: i had to do some online thing as well as activities.
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: Why
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Adela: it’s okay because weirdly? i actually enjoy writing. like a lot. just the art of writing and taking notes, etc.
2018/01/26, 22:10 - Adela: and i listen to music while i do it so i actually enjoy working. i’m such a nerd :):
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: I kinda understand
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Adela: my teacher on steroids
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Adela: oh thank goodness.
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: There was something earlier that I forgot now
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: Why lol
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Adela: people think i’m weird.
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: Ohhh
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: People think I'm weird
2018/01/26, 22:11 - Adela: especially my mom. she wants me to have more of a social life, but she kinda gets it? because she was the same
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: A passion for writing is good
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Adela: same, but i’ve learnt to actually not care
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Adela: fuck wm
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Adela: em*
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Adela: i love love writing. i used to write books. idk if i ever told you about this
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: Yeah same-ish
2018/01/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: No you haven't
2018/01/26, 22:14 - Jhyan: Ok ttyl
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Adela: what is later?
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: Now I guess
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Adela: oh okayyy. guess i don’t talk as much as i think i do
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Adela: hehe
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/01/26, 22:15 - Adela: yeah caring about people is a waste of time. you just end up ruining your own happiness
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Jhyan: Wait have I told you about the Chinese room
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Adela: and jeopardising it all the time, so it’s just not worth it
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Adela: i don’t think so
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Jhyan: I really love this analogy thing
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Jhyan: I don't remember who came up with it but Alan Turing comes to mind
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Jhyan: Anyway
2018/01/26, 22:16 - Adela: i’m all ears...
2018/01/26, 22:17 - Jhyan: So imagine a room with a locked door and all the necessary things for a human.
2018/01/26, 22:17 - Jhyan: There is a slit in the door for paper to pass through
2018/01/26, 22:17 - Jhyan: And a human inside
2018/01/26, 22:17 - Jhyan: This human *cannot* speak or understand Chinese
2018/01/26, 22:18 - Jhyan: But s/he has a handbook that tells it what Chinese characters to respond with when given certain Chinese characters
2018/01/26, 22:19 - Jhyan: So person B (the one giving papers into the room) thinks that this man inside the room can understand Chinese
2018/01/26, 22:19 - Jhyan: Because he isn't told about the handbook
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Adela: damn
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Jhyan: Now imagine you are the person B, and the man inside is your computer/phone
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Adela: you know some other deep shit, anyways continue...
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Jhyan: It's an analogy for computers
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Jhyan: Or AI
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Adela: mmmh that makes hypothetical sense
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Adela: yeah AI is pretty scary
2018/01/26, 22:20 - Jhyan: And it's so nice because it's so accurate
2018/01/26, 22:21 - Jhyan: The machine doesn't understand, but it knows how to respond
2018/01/26, 22:21 - Jhyan: There's also another thing: what happens if person B is also in a room with a handbook?
2018/01/26, 22:22 - Jhyan: 22:22
2018/01/26, 22:23 - Jhyan: Oh also I had a thought related to this type of thing
2018/01/26, 22:47 - Adela: what’s your amazing thought?
2018/01/26, 22:47 - Adela: then i guess you’ve mastered the programme
2018/01/26, 22:48 - Jhyan: It's not that amazing
2018/01/26, 22:48 - Jhyan: Just that society values being social too much
2018/01/26, 22:48 - Jhyan: And also a theoretical explanation for why
2018/01/26, 22:49 - Jhyan: Lol I love how I always make it sound like some super advanced thing
2018/01/26, 22:50 - Jhyan: The reason why is logical. It's because extroverts like being around extroverts and somewhat like being around introverts, but introverts don't like being around anyone else that much.
2018/01/26, 22:50 - Jhyan: That means that all the people doing the judging, will be extroverts, social people
2018/01/26, 22:51 - Jhyan: And they usually like people more when they're more social.
2018/01/26, 22:52 - Jhyan: Ok like if there was a magnet that repelled everything and a magnet that attracted everything, but only attracted the repulsion magnet a little bit
2018/01/26, 22:52 - Jhyan: Jesus
2018/01/26, 22:52 - Jhyan: Ok I'll write it down professionally and send it to you
2018/01/26, 22:52 - Jhyan: Coz I'm tired and I don't think this makes sense
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Adela: yeahh
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Adela: yohh im tired too
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Adela: join the club
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Jhyan: But it's a Friday so...
2018/01/26, 23:26 - Jhyan: Do you ever want to sleep?
2018/01/26, 23:27 - Jhyan: But can't?
2018/01/26, 23:28 - Adela: yes that’s me every single weeknight
2018/01/26, 23:28 - Adela: that’s why i get like 5 hours of sleep a day
2018/01/26, 23:28 - Jhyan: So why don't you try to sleep earlier
2018/01/26, 23:28 - Jhyan: Sorry if you've told me this
2018/01/26, 23:31 - Adela: i really can’t. during the holidays i slept at like 4am so im so used to that lifestyle. also i get distracted right before bed and generally don’t feel tired... until it’s time to wake up
2018/01/26, 23:32 - Jhyan: Wow
2018/01/26, 23:32 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/01/26, 23:32 - Jhyan: Yoh idk what to say about that
2018/01/26, 23:33 - Jhyan: Ok how about try and sleep early and find out what it's like and then maybe it'll be nice and your brain will try to do it?
2018/01/27, 00:27 - Adela: i can’t sleep early, like i end up tossing and turning until 11pm no matter what happens
2018/01/27, 01:57 - Jhyan: Sounds like you accidentally rewired your brain
2018/01/27, 01:57 - Jhyan: Anyway good night/morning
2018/01/27, 01:58 - Jhyan: Woah

2018/01/27, 01:58 - Jhyan: Well you do... Early in the morning that is
2018/01/27, 01:59 - Jhyan: It took me 8h to watch The Imitation Game
2018/01/27, 01:59 - Jhyan: And I'm still not done
2018/01/27, 02:00 - Jhyan: I watched it in bits and pieces
2018/01/27, 02:00 - Jhyan: Ok I need to sleep so

2018/01/27, 22:06 - Jhyan: Uh I wasn't waiting for an hour for you to come online lol what a coincidence
2018/01/27, 22:06 - Adela: yeah sure
2018/01/27, 22:06 - Adela: coincidence. it was just meant to be
2018/01/27, 22:06 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Adela: so what’s the question
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Jhyan: Is it important to you to talk face-to-face?
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Adela: for what?
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Jhyan: Like idk
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/01/27, 22:07 - Adela: for a relationship?
2018/01/27, 22:08 - Jhyan: No
2018/01/27, 22:08 - Jhyan: Sorry nvm
2018/01/27, 22:08 - Jhyan: What did you do today?
2018/01/27, 22:09 - Adela: i went out with a few friends to rosebank. what about you?
2018/01/27, 22:09 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2018/01/27, 22:09 - Jhyan: Played some games, watched some stuff, nothing much
2018/01/27, 22:17 - Jhyan: Sorry for doing this
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Adela: sounds cool
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Jhyan: Wice - Star Fighter
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Adela: i want to read but i’m pretty tired rn
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Adela: it’s okay don’t worry
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Jhyan: Read?
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Jhyan: This is some cool music
2018/01/27, 22:22 - Jhyan: And it has a nice video with it aswell
2018/01/28, 00:17 - Adela: will listen
2018/01/28, 00:17 - Adela: yeah my book, the infinite sea
2018/01/28, 00:17 - Jhyan: What's it about
2018/01/28, 00:17 - Jhyan: It'll surprise you
2018/01/28, 00:18 - Adela: alien invasion into planet earth
2018/01/28, 00:19 - Jhyan: Hmm
2018/01/28, 00:19 - Jhyan: Didn't you just read something similar...
2018/01/28, 00:20 - Jhyan: Haha
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Adela: it has a really nice tune
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Jhyan: You know there was this alien invasion in the Marvel universe
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Adela: uhm i’m reading the second book of the same series so maybe
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Jhyan: Yeah it's called "Synthwave"
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Adela: idk if i told you about the previous book
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Jhyan: The music
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Adela: damn no i didn’t
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Adela: yeah that song was cool
2018/01/28, 00:21 - Jhyan: The 5th Wave is what I mean
2018/01/28, 00:22 - Jhyan: It was called the Secret Invasion. Basically they replaced people and Heroes and whatever
2018/01/28, 00:23 - Jhyan: And the illuminati was formed (Tony Stark, Charles Xavier, Doctor Strange, BlackBolt, a few others)
2018/01/28, 00:23 - Jhyan: And they were the last ones left to trust each other
2018/01/28, 00:23 - Jhyan: And then they slowly got rid of the aliens
2018/01/28, 00:24 - Jhyan: And I think there was like no actual war, people didn't even know about it
2018/01/28, 00:27 - Adela: damn that’s some deep shit
2018/01/28, 00:27 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Jhyan: You know I read this on Wikipedia for fun
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Adela: the 5th wave is a pretty cool concept because it deals with the theory that aliens don’t have a complete body but are just beings
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Adela: that need a host and a body to take over and hold their spirit
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Adela: damn you have energy hey
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Jhyan: Like my thing that I said
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Jhyan: Did I tell you
2018/01/28, 00:28 - Jhyan: What makes you say that?
2018/01/28, 00:29 - Jhyan: Well basically it's about how scientists are expecting life to be just like us: requires water, has DNA, uses cellular activity, etc etc
2018/01/28, 00:29 - Jhyan: But life is literally so pliable
2018/01/28, 00:30 - Jhyan: Technically a star is an organism because it carries out all the life functions (I think, I'm too lazy to list them all)
2018/01/28, 00:31 - Jhyan: But I do know that computer viruses do that, and are literally organisms
2018/01/28, 00:32 - Adela: you research a lot of things and read up of them
2018/01/28, 00:32 - Jhyan: A digital life, proteins of bits, cells of bytes, legs made from lines of code
2018/01/28, 00:32 - Jhyan: Oh lol
2018/01/28, 00:32 - Adela: speaking of viruses, my dad’s phone started doing this weird thing when it called one person like 12 times
2018/01/28, 00:32 - Jhyan: Woah
2018/01/28, 00:33 - Jhyan: Phone viruses are really rare these days
2018/01/28, 00:33 - Jhyan: Speaking of, didn't Mik'ail get one from watching porn that froze his phone and then he tested it on Miles' phone and froze that too like a while back
2018/01/28, 00:40 - Jhyan: I read one article from like a thing referenced in a show like HYDRA or something and then I see a link to an event and I read it and then I see a special iron man armour that was specific to that even and then I find a material used to make it that's only on a certain Moon and then .............
2018/01/28, 00:40 - Jhyan: That's why I research Marvel stuff
2018/01/28, 00:42 - Adela: i don’t remember that thing about porn...
2018/01/28, 00:42 - Jhyan: Well I remember it
2018/01/28, 00:43 - Jhyan: It doesn't matter
2018/01/28, 00:50 - Jhyan: Are you gonna keep your read receipts off forever?
2018/01/28, 01:35 - Adela: yeah i think so. i like the comfort of them being off and me remaining unpredictable
2018/01/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: Good night
2018/01/30, 07:49 - Jhyan: This was about me and you.  What I really meant was that it was important to me, and I want to talk IRL more. You said you wanted to talk more.
2018/01/30, 15:11 - Jhyan: Sorry if this comes off weird
2018/01/30, 18:06 - Adela: nahh it’s all fine.
2018/01/30, 18:06 - Adela: yeah i guess talking in person is a lot better
2018/01/30, 18:12 - Jhyan: School makes it hard though
2018/01/30, 18:14 - Jhyan: Do you want to do something sometime maybe?
2018/01/30, 21:59 - Adela: yeah sure that would be really cool
2018/01/30, 22:00 - Jhyan: I overthink things too much
2018/01/30, 22:00 - Jhyan: This is such an easy thing
2018/01/30, 22:00 - Jhyan: But I make it hell for myself
2018/01/30, 22:00 - Jhyan: Thanks also
2018/01/31, 05:36 - Adela: try nor to, don’t put too much unnecessary pressure on yourself. it’s not good for yku
2018/01/31, 06:44 - Jhyan: Easier said than done
2018/01/31, 14:46 - Jhyan: What's your favourite movie
2018/01/31, 16:58 - Adela: far from the madding crowd
2018/01/31, 22:08 - Jhyan: Ok nice
2018/02/03, 23:36 - Jhyan: Hey
2018/02/03, 23:36 - Jhyan: What's up?
2018/02/03, 23:37 - Jhyan: What did you do today?
2018/02/04, 00:14 - Adela: nothing much. i bought some art supplies, drew and so on and so forth today. what about you?
2018/02/04, 00:15 - Jhyan: I got shwarmas earlier
2018/02/04, 00:16 - Jhyan: Didn't really do anything else, unless you count the progress in a game, which was really hard to do
2018/02/04, 00:17 - Jhyan: I finished rewatching 13 Reasons Why
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Adela: love that series
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Jhyan: Same
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Jhyan: They made it really well
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Adela: it’s nice
2018/02/04, 14:28 - Adela: but too sad
2018/02/04, 14:29 - Jhyan: Well that's what tells you they did a good storytelling job
2018/02/04, 14:30 - Jhyan: Something I hate is that they can't ever make another season
2018/02/04, 16:46 - Adela: they can, apparently they were going to. a whole justice for hannah sort of thing?
2018/02/04, 16:46 - Jhyan: Oh yeah that's fine
2018/02/04, 16:47 - Jhyan: But I meant if they tried the school shooting thing they were hinting at and he had 13 reasons
2018/02/04, 16:47 - Jhyan: I actually really want to see this
2018/02/04, 17:39 - Adela: it would be nice.
2018/02/04, 17:39 - Adela: have you watched “the end of the fucking world”?
2018/02/04, 17:40 - Jhyan: Haha
2018/02/04, 17:40 - Jhyan: I asked _you_ that
2018/02/04, 17:40 - Jhyan: Long ago
2018/02/04, 17:40 - Jhyan: Yeah I good
2018/02/04, 17:40 - Jhyan: *did
2018/02/04, 17:47 - Adela: oh yes
2018/02/04, 17:47 - Adela: i’m so lost i swear
2018/02/04, 17:47 - Jhyan: Just tired probably
2018/02/04, 17:47 - Jhyan: Wait
2018/02/04, 17:47 - Jhyan: When did you wake up
2018/02/04, 18:02 - Adela: like 10?
2018/02/04, 18:02 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Adela: yeahhh
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Adela: i just take really long to get to whatsapps for some reason
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Jhyan: You do still get a good amount of sleep
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Jhyan: Wdym
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/02/04, 18:03 - Adela: i started that drawing journal and i’m really enjoying it because before whenever i wanted to draw i’d be like “nah it’s not important”
2018/02/04, 18:04 - Adela: but now it’s homework so i have an excuse to lose myself while drawing which is really nice
2018/02/04, 18:04 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/02/04, 18:04 - Jhyan: I know what you mean
2018/02/04, 18:04 - Jhyan: Like I didn't think it was a good enough idea to actually draw
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Adela: exactly but now it’s a “have-to” so it’s much nicer
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Adela: i think im gonna continue with this for the rest of the year
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Jhyan: Cool
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Jhyan: Maybe I will
2018/02/04, 18:05 - Jhyan: Idk though
2018/02/04, 21:12 - Jhyan: Well that's another weekend wasted
2018/02/04, 21:15 - Jhyan: Good night
2018/02/04, 21:15 - Jhyan: See you tomorrow
2018/02/05, 05:35 - Adela: amen to that
2018/02/08, 18:57 - Jhyan: Earlier I thought it was Friday
2018/02/08, 18:57 - Jhyan: And then there came the crushing realization
2018/02/08, 18:58 - Jhyan: Woah
2018/02/08, 18:58 - Adela: i wishh but this week is going pretty fast though
2018/02/08, 18:58 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/02/08, 18:58 - Jhyan: At least
2018/02/08, 18:58 - Jhyan: Last week felt like bullet time
2018/02/08, 18:59 - Jhyan: They're making a movie of one of my favourite books
2018/02/08, 19:00 - Jhyan: It's that one I told you about, with the kids that die and then the remainder get sent to camps
2018/02/08, 19:00 - Jhyan: The Darkest Minds
2018/02/08, 20:03 - Adela: oh damn i’m happy for you
2018/02/08, 20:03 - Adela: i’m being swamped with homework currently urgh
2018/02/08, 20:07 - Jhyan: My sister says she wants to cut her hair like yours
2018/02/08, 20:08 - Jhyan: Which?
2018/02/08, 20:08 - Jhyan: She even tied it like that to "see how it looks"
2018/02/08, 20:51 - Adela: maths, ns, art, geography, science fair...
2018/02/08, 20:51 - Adela: i want to cut my hair shorter too

2018/02/08, 20:52 - Jhyan: The science fair
2018/02/08, 20:58 - Jhyan: Is it weird that she wants hair like yours?
2018/02/08, 21:13 - Adela: did she say it exactly like that
2018/02/08, 21:13 - Adela: like “i want adela’s hair”
2018/02/08, 21:13 - Adela: i mean, it’s cool if its just a style she’s after
2018/02/08, 21:14 - Adela: yup anxiety4me
2018/02/08, 21:33 - Jhyan: No she said she wanted to cut it like yours
2018/02/09, 05:38 - Adela: oh okay
2018/02/09, 15:15 - Jhyan: Finally
2018/02/09, 15:15 - Jhyan: We didn't have to hand in the science fair because we didn't have science
2018/02/09, 16:48 - Adela: yeah it’s only due on monday
2018/02/09, 16:51 - Jhyan: Life saver
2018/02/09, 18:43 - Adela: yup hey. but our teacher told us it’s due on the 12th

2018/02/28, 18:47 - Jhyan: For coming to me earlier and actually talking to me.
2018/02/28, 19:51 - Adela: ahh you’re always welcome, you’re a special person. i hope you never forget that
2018/02/28, 19:54 - Jhyan: :)
2018/03/01, 19:52 - Jhyan: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U0S_WE8hmvYWB8f77tC2D6EWm-cU4-YO
2018/03/01, 19:52 - Jhyan: It's a short story I just wrote
2018/03/01, 19:58 - Jhyan: Sorry for mistakes
2018/03/01, 20:00 - Jhyan: And the fonts aren't translated properly lol
2018/03/01, 21:50 - Adela: thats really cool. where’d you get the idea?
2018/03/01, 21:51 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/03/01, 21:52 - Jhyan: I just had this type of stuff in my head recently
2018/03/01, 21:52 - Jhyan: Like I was imagining a language in which you can say paradoxes, but they won't be able to not make sense
2018/03/01, 21:53 - Jhyan: It was exactly like my ideas for my artworks
2018/03/01, 21:53 - Adela: ohh that’s cool
2018/03/01, 21:53 - Jhyan: They just "call" to me lol
2018/03/01, 21:54 - Adela: that’s cool. i feel creatively uninspired all the time
2018/03/01, 21:54 - Jhyan: Wait I'm gonna show you what it looks like with the fonts which
2018/03/01, 21:54 - Jhyan: *quick
2018/03/01, 21:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/03/01, 21:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/03/01, 22:07 - Jhyan: Now that I think about it I've had these ideas for longer than I knew. I had always played with the idea of worlds that didn't make any sense in our reality and were formed from entirely different ideas. Like you could come up with a whole complex maths system that is useless to people in real life but if it made sense to itself it would work somewhere else.
2018/03/01, 23:27 - Adela: yohhh the title fonts are really nicd
2018/03/01, 23:27 - Adela: nice
2018/03/01, 23:28 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/03/02, 11:33 - Jhyan: Woah just imagine creating worlds like I've mentioned in a lucid dream
2018/03/02, 16:58 - Adela: i wish i could live in another world
2018/03/02, 16:58 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/03/02, 16:58 - Jhyan: Me too
2018/03/02, 18:33 - Adela: this world is too fucked up
2018/03/07, 14:20 - Jhyan: I didn't tell you why I can't just forget about Tam
2018/03/07, 14:27 - Jhyan: We still have mutual friends and are near each other, so she can still hurt me.
2018/03/07, 14:30 - Jhyan: And also then I'd lose traction socially – I would just be tagging alongside Sebastian etc. because I'm not good enough friends with Tamara's other friends
2018/03/07, 14:30 - Jhyan: And there's just the simple psychological aspect
2018/03/07, 14:32 - Jhyan: It's hard to forget about someone that easily
2018/03/07, 14:34 - Jhyan: And if I cut contact I wouldn't have mattered as much as now, which is not a lot at all, I detriment people if anything usually
2018/03/07, 14:34 - Jhyan: And I don't want to be remembered like this
2018/03/07, 14:35 - Jhyan: There are lots of insignificant reasons as to why I can't that I won't mention aswell
2018/03/07, 14:36 - Jhyan: Sorry for not telling you when we talked, I wasn't thinking clearly and didn't want to argue because I didn't want to take your time, and I'm just awkward
2018/03/07, 14:38 - Jhyan: And sorry for telling you this because you now have to read it and get saddened or waste your time on replying
2018/03/08, 18:32 - Adela: hi i saw your message earlier, but wanted to read it properly before giving you a reply because i thought that would be fair.
2018/03/08, 18:32 - Adela: getting over someone is never easy and so is forgetting, but it’s also good for your health. and yes, even on my side, there are some people i can’t forgot about so it’s easier said than done.
2018/03/08, 18:33 - Adela: i just honestly wish you growth in getting over her because i don’t personally think the whole relationship is healthy for either of you - which is sometimes the case (my ex and i were like this)
2018/03/08, 18:36 - Jhyan: Thanks for the advice
2018/03/08, 18:37 - Jhyan: I'll try to somehow do this despite the challenges
2018/03/10, 00:41 - Jhyan: I was just going to sleep now
2018/03/10, 00:41 - Jhyan: And I remembered...
2018/03/10, 00:41 - Jhyan: Happy birthday
2018/03/10, 09:10 - Adela: thanks so much jhyan
2018/03/10, 09:11 - Jhyan: :)
2018/03/10, 22:42 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/03/11, 00:23 - Adela: ooof that’s me
2018/03/23, 10:00 - Jhyan: Mrs Loh volunteered you for a Wits competition
2018/03/23, 23:12 - Adela: oh no :(
2018/03/23, 23:12 - Jhyan: Haha
2018/03/23, 23:12 - Jhyan: You don't have to do it
2018/03/23, 23:13 - Jhyan: She told us to tell you
2018/03/23, 23:14 - Jhyan: Coz me, Sebastian, Mika'il, and Mpuma were aswell
2018/03/23, 23:14 - Adela: when is this?
2018/03/23, 23:14 - Jhyan: Idk she didn't tell us
2018/03/23, 23:14 - Jhyan: I'll ask her for details on Monday
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Jhyan: It's not very soon
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Jhyan: I don't think
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Adela: okay cool, ill be back on monday so
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Jhyan: But you didn't have to do it anyway
2018/03/23, 23:15 - Jhyan: It's not for marks
2018/03/23, 23:18 - Adela: okay. my parents would want me to do it because they want me to be more participative
2018/03/23, 23:18 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2018/03/26, 17:27 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/03/26, 17:27 - Jhyan: There you go
2018/03/26, 17:45 - Adela: that’s cool, thanks
2018/03/26, 17:45 - Jhyan: No problemo
2018/03/27, 23:24 - Jhyan: I fucked up this term
2018/03/27, 23:24 - Jhyan: My marks are down the drain
2018/03/27, 23:24 - Jhyan: At least by my standards
2018/03/27, 23:25 - Jhyan: I'm getting 55% for art instead of 81% because I just LOST the assignment
2018/03/27, 23:26 - Jhyan: And it's all caused by me, and my mom is gonna freak out at me for this, making it even worse
2018/03/27, 23:26 - Jhyan: How's your voice btw
2018/03/28, 05:37 - Adela: i’m really sorry jhyan, don’t give up, next term can be your time to shine
2018/03/28, 05:37 - Adela: it’s getting better
2018/03/28, 05:37 - Adela: not 100% yet
2018/04/01, 12:53 - Jhyan: Hey Adela
2018/04/01, 12:53 - Jhyan: What's up
2018/04/01, 13:37 - Adela: nothing much, just gotta do the dishes
2018/04/01, 13:40 - Jhyan: Dishes are the worst
2018/04/01, 15:26 - Adela: they really are, especially if there’s food on the plates still
2018/04/01, 15:27 - Jhyan: Was there?
2018/04/01, 15:42 - Jhyan: Oh yeah it's April fool's
2018/04/01, 15:43 - Jhyan: If your didn't know
2018/04/01, 15:43 - Jhyan: *you

2018/04/02, 16:18 - Jhyan: Look at the bad joke detector from Google
2018/04/02, 16:18 - Jhyan: Is their April fool's thing
2018/04/02, 19:32 - Adela: i didnt see it,

2018/04/02, 19:41 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/02, 19:41 - Adela: i watched it right now
2018/04/02, 19:41 - Adela: yup
2018/04/02, 19:42 - Jhyan: I love how they throw around bullshit terms
2018/04/02, 19:42 - Adela: yeah it’s hella weird though
2018/04/02, 19:42 - Adela: but a good idea
2018/04/02, 19:42 - Jhyan: "our team equipped with neural networks, blockchains and, of course, virtual reality"
2018/04/02, 19:43 - Jhyan: And they were pouring chemicals in an over-the-top way labelled "hard work" or whatever into another thing that said "success"
2018/04/02, 20:23 - Adela: i want to see some epic april fools jokes
2018/04/02, 20:35 - Jhyan: Like?
2018/04/02, 20:36 - Jhyan: Do you know what happened with 13 Reasons Why season 2
2018/04/02, 20:36 - Jhyan: Coz it was supposed to be here
2018/04/02, 20:36 - Jhyan: But then I thought it might've been an April fool's joke
2018/04/02, 20:41 - Adela: nah i don’t think it’s happening
2018/04/02, 20:42 - Jhyan: Was it just a really well organized practical joke
2018/04/02, 20:42 - Jhyan: Also apparently there's something big planned for 2019 by the British government
2018/04/02, 20:54 - Adela: oouu
2018/04/02, 20:55 - Adela: i think so, or maybe it’s coming but much later on...
2018/04/02, 20:55 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/02, 20:55 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/04/02, 20:55 - Jhyan: Last year Rick and Morty dropped episode 1 on April fool's
2018/04/02, 21:02 - Adela: which season?

2018/04/02, 21:25 - Jhyan: I don't mind
2018/04/02, 21:25 - Jhyan: We all like different things
2018/04/02, 21:42 - Adela: yeah i’m into “full house” because it makes me happy
2018/04/02, 21:42 - Jhyan: Never heard of it
2018/04/02, 21:57 - Adela: it’s an 80’s show

2018/04/11, 18:13 - Adela: it’s been great to see my family and stuff
2018/05/09, 07:16 - Jhyan: Do you by any chance know when the maths thing is
2018/05/09, 07:16 - Jhyan: Like where at wits
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Adela: i actually don’t know :(
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Adela: think i’m just gonna go to wits and ask them
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Jhyan: It's cool
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Adela: because it said like some hall on the paper we got
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Jhyan: I have an invitation
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Jhyan: I'll send a picture after this lesson
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Jhyan: I just forgot about it
2018/05/09, 13:43 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/05/09, 13:44 - Adela: yeah i have it @ home
2018/05/09, 13:44 - Adela: i really don’t wanna go to this thing. damn
2018/05/09, 14:39 - Jhyan: Do you still want a picture then
2018/05/09, 15:45 - Jhyan: Ok I guess not
2018/05/09, 16:51 - Adela: when are you coming?
2018/05/09, 16:51 - Jhyan: I'm here
2018/05/09, 16:51 - Jhyan: Are you?
2018/05/09, 16:52 - Adela: yeah i am
2018/05/09, 16:52 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Adela: where are you
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Jhyan: At the flower hall
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Jhyan: You?
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Adela: i am too!
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Jhyan: Mika'il is shortly behind somewhere
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Adela: the fuck?
2018/05/09, 16:53 - Adela: where are you?
2018/05/09, 19:57 - Jhyan: So how was it
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: I had sharp and really painful stomach pains the whole time
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: And still do
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: Coz I ate my dad's wraps
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Adela: ouch
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Adela: i hated it
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: Why?
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Adela: started guessing near the end
2018/05/09, 20:01 - Jhyan: For the multiple choice?
2018/05/09, 20:02 - Jhyan: Or section B
2018/05/09, 20:02 - Jhyan: Did you try section C
2018/05/09, 20:02 - Adela: everything
2018/05/09, 20:03 - Jhyan: But how could you guess on section B and C?
2018/05/09, 20:07 - Jhyan: What was the hardest one for you?
2018/05/09, 20:14 - Adela: all of them
2018/05/09, 20:14 - Adela: not even gonna try sugarcoat
2018/05/09, 20:35 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/05/09, 20:37 - Jhyan: If you had to guess, what percentage do you think you got on it
2018/05/09, 20:39 - Jhyan: I think I got 80/120
2018/05/09, 20:40 - Jhyan: So 67%
2018/05/09, 20:47 - Jhyan: I hope you got good marks
2018/05/09, 20:48 - Jhyan: Enjoy your evening
2018/05/09, 20:49 - Adela: probably like 50%
2018/05/09, 20:49 - Adela: you too
2018/05/12, 11:04 - Jhyan: I'm deeply sorry Adela
2018/05/12, 11:07 - Jhyan: You know it's weird
2018/05/12, 11:14 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/05/12, 11:14 - Jhyan: I'll tell you later
2018/05/12, 13:31 - Adela: sorry about what?
2018/05/13, 11:17 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/05/13, 11:17 - Jhyan: What's up
2018/05/13, 11:17 - Jhyan: You'll hear about it eventually down the line
2018/05/13, 11:44 - Jhyan: Charlie Oscar Golf
2018/05/13, 11:45 - Jhyan: Say those codewords to Sebastian if you want to know
2018/05/13, 11:50 - Jhyan: Don't freak out
2018/05/13, 12:48 - Adela: jhyan are you okay?
2018/05/13, 12:48 - Jhyan: Ask Sebastian
2018/05/13, 12:48 - Jhyan: Charlie Oscar Golf
2018/05/13, 13:32 - Adela: okay...
2018/05/13, 17:19 - Jhyan: Did you ask him
2018/05/13, 17:31 - Adela: nope
2018/05/13, 17:31 - Adela: i don’t have his number
2018/05/13, 17:42 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/05/13, 17:42 - Jhyan: Do you want me to tell you myself?
2018/05/13, 17:43 - Jhyan: Or do you want his number?
2018/05/13, 17:50 - Adela: yeah just tell me
2018/05/13, 17:50 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/13, 17:51 - Jhyan: Just a sec

2018/05/13, 17:51 - Jhyan: I'll be back in 5
2018/05/13, 17:52 - Jhyan: I shot myself with a crossbow
2018/05/13, 17:52 - Jhyan: But I didn't die
2018/05/13, 17:52 - Jhyan: I had a bolt stuck in my head
2018/05/13, 17:52 - Jhyan: They did surgery and I'm in ICU at Milpark
2018/05/13, 17:53 - Jhyan: Please don't freak out
2018/05/13, 17:54 - Adela: jhyan why?
2018/05/13, 17:55 - Adela: jhyan you really need to get help, from someone professional because it’s not normal to feel this way.
2018/05/13, 17:55 - Jhyan: I don't think that's optional anymore
2018/05/13, 17:55 - Adela: • listen to music that makes you happy
• cut out everything that’s making you sad 
• watch movies that make you smile
• do things that make you happy
2018/05/13, 17:56 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/05/13, 17:56 - Jhyan: I'm sorry
2018/05/13, 17:57 - Adela: don’t be sorry, never be sorry. it’s not your fault.
2018/05/13, 17:57 - Adela: you’re just sad and i get that, everyone gets sad sometimes
2018/05/13, 17:57 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/13, 17:58 - Adela: but if you’re sad too often, then that’s how you know that you need to do something about it
2018/05/13, 17:58 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/13, 17:58 - Jhyan: I am
2018/05/13, 18:18 - Jhyan: So how are you?
2018/05/13, 19:17 - Adela: i’m okay hey
2018/05/13, 21:06 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/13, 21:07 - Jhyan: What did you do this weekend?
2018/05/13, 23:14 - Adela: i had a soccer tournament yesterday, furthemore i ate and got sick
2018/05/14, 08:36 - Jhyan: So are you at school?

2018/05/14, 10:03 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/05/14, 10:03 - Jhyan: My spine hurts
2018/05/14, 10:03 - Jhyan: From lying on my back for so long
2018/05/14, 10:04 - Jhyan: And my nose is dry from oxygen
2018/05/14, 10:04 - Jhyan: But otherwise
2018/05/14, 10:04 - Jhyan: I'm fine
2018/05/14, 10:05 - Jhyan: So it's really itchy
2018/05/14, 14:40 - Adela: i hope you feel better soon
2018/05/14, 15:25 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/05/14, 15:25 - Jhyan: I think I'm getting released tomorrow
2018/05/14, 15:26 - Adela: oh at least. when are you coming back to school
2018/05/14, 15:26 - Jhyan: I don't know
2018/05/14, 17:40 - Jhyan: Ok I just heard it will be about a month
2018/05/14, 17:40 - Jhyan: Until I come back
2018/05/16, 15:04 - Jhyan: You know that game that you played
2018/05/16, 15:04 - Jhyan: It was a puzzle game
2018/05/16, 15:04 - Jhyan: With the robot that you controlled
2018/05/16, 15:05 - Jhyan: I wanted to tell you
2018/05/16, 15:05 - Jhyan: You can find solutions faster when you work backwards often
2018/05/16, 15:05 - Jhyan: Backwards from the solution
2018/05/16, 15:06 - Jhyan: And see where you need to get to first
2018/05/16, 15:06 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/05/16, 15:06 - Jhyan: You probably don't even play it anymore
2018/05/16, 15:06 - Jhyan: But yeah
2018/05/16, 15:16 - Jhyan: It's called mekorama
2018/05/16, 17:48 - Adela: thanks, you think about so much so often
2018/05/16, 17:49 - Adela: yeah that game is pretty cool though, i remember when we solved a level together
2018/05/16, 18:16 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/05/16, 18:16 - Jhyan: That was nice
2018/05/16, 18:35 - Adela: it was
2018/05/16, 18:36 - Jhyan: I'm sorry
2018/05/16, 18:36 - Jhyan: I said it already
2018/05/16, 18:36 - Jhyan: But I wanted to say it again
2018/05/16, 20:03 - Adela: you don’t need to be sorry, it’s fine.
2018/05/18, 19:45 - Jhyan: I'm back at home now
2018/05/18, 19:46 - Jhyan: Anything new?
2018/05/19, 00:28 - Adela: that’s good to hear
2018/05/19, 00:28 - Adela: nope
2018/05/21, 21:25 - Jhyan: Hey
2018/05/21, 21:25 - Jhyan: How are you doing?
2018/05/21, 22:39 - Adela: i’m good and you?
2018/05/21, 22:40 - Jhyan: I was gonna say I'm good, then I was gonna say I'm still bad but gonna get better. I don't know what I am
2018/05/21, 22:41 - Jhyan: Anyway it's good to hear you're not doing badly
2018/05/22, 10:12 - Adela: i hope you feel better soon
2018/05/22, 10:14 - Jhyan: Thank you
2018/06/19, 16:13 - Jhyan: Hey

2018/06/19, 19:49 - Adela: hey, we haven’t. things have been okay
2018/06/19, 19:49 - Adela: what about with you?
2018/06/19, 21:44 - Jhyan: I never know what I'm supposed to say to that question
2018/06/19, 21:58 - Adela: you’re still struggling?
2018/06/19, 21:58 - Adela: i’m sorry jhyan :(
2018/06/19, 21:58 - Jhyan: You don't have to be sorry
2018/06/19, 21:58 - Jhyan: But thanks
2018/06/19, 21:58 - Jhyan: How was eid?
2018/06/19, 21:59 - Jhyan: I know it's late

2018/06/19, 21:59 - Adela: it’s fine. thnx for asking
2018/06/19, 21:59 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/06/19, 21:59 - Jhyan: Cool

2018/06/19, 22:01 - Jhyan: Good night
2018/06/20, 07:36 - Adela: i’m really bad at replying on whatsapp. sorry.
2018/06/20, 07:36 - Adela: i only have ns on thursday
2018/06/20, 07:36 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/06/20, 07:37 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/29, 15:11 - Jhyan: So...
2018/06/29, 15:11 - Jhyan: **looks guiltily for the abomination of a joke about to come out of his mouth**
2018/06/29, 15:11 - Jhyan: You studying hard or hardly studying? 
**Wheeze**
2018/06/29, 23:13 - Adela: hardly studying. been doing all the assignments
2018/06/29, 23:13 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/29, 23:13 - Jhyan: That's pretty shit
2018/06/29, 23:14 - Jhyan: Which assignments?
2018/06/29, 23:15 - Adela: geography and relo
2018/06/29, 23:15 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/29, 23:15 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/07/05, 14:57 - Jhyan: What were your parents' opinions on what happened
2018/07/05, 16:18 - Adela: on what?
2018/07/05, 17:02 - Jhyan: What I did
2018/07/05, 17:02 - Jhyan: And me, after what happened
2018/07/05, 20:08 - Adela: well i told them what happened and they don’t really have much of an opinion on it, just wanted to know if i was okay
2018/07/05, 20:08 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/07/17, 08:15 - Jhyan: Do you think it's wrong for Sebastian to have become friends with Tamara when he knows how much she hurt me, or am I the wrong one because I'm feeling betrayed and I want a good friendship to stop?
2018/07/17, 08:15 - Jhyan: I'm sorry for telling you this
2018/07/17, 08:15 - Jhyan: You don't have to answer
2018/07/17, 13:21 - Adela: well you’re entitled to feel how you feel, but he is too. what affected you didn’t necessarily affect him as well so you can understand why he is still able to be friends with her. it’s up to you.
2018/07/17, 13:28 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/07/17, 13:28 - Jhyan: Thanks for your opinion
2018/08/03, 12:44 - Jhyan: Have you watched The Office
2018/08/03, 12:44 - Jhyan: My sister thought you'd like it, idk what that's worth
2018/08/03, 15:22 - Adela: your sister thinks of what i’d like? that’s kinda cute
2018/08/03, 15:22 - Adela: i watched one episode and it was enjoyable tbh
2018/08/03, 15:22 - Adela: maybe i’ll watch more in these holidays
2018/08/03, 15:23 - Jhyan: Nah basically I started it and she was like I think Adela would like it
2018/08/03, 15:24 - Jhyan: She does it a lot, guessing things about based on intuition
2018/08/03, 15:24 - Adela: ah that’s sweet. thanks for thinking of me, both of you
2018/08/03, 15:24 - Jhyan: Ok haha
2018/08/03, 15:24 - Jhyan: *about people
2018/08/03, 15:25 - Jhyan: It's why she likes horoscopes I think
2018/08/03, 15:25 - Jhyan: She likes that type of thing
2018/08/03, 15:28 - Adela: ah that’s pretty cool tbh
2018/08/06, 22:00 - Jhyan: You wanna see a meme video I made
2018/08/06, 22:00 - Jhyan: Ok I'll just send it
2018/08/06, 22:00 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/08/06, 22:00 - Jhyan: https://www.reddit.com/r/dankvideos/comments/953ctq/metal_alien_howard_visits_jacksepticeye_in_bed/
2018/08/06, 22:04 - Adela: will check it out
2018/08/06, 22:04 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/08/08, 16:33 - Jhyan: So what did you think
2018/08/08, 16:50 - Adela: i can’t get it to play
2018/08/08, 16:52 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/08/19, 22:58 - Jhyan: How come you're posting a status on WhatsApp? That's kinda rare of you to do
2018/08/19, 22:59 - Adela: ik, right? but i just love amy winehouse
2018/08/19, 22:59 - Adela: and i didn’t feel like posting on snapchat
2018/08/19, 23:00 - Jhyan: Ah, I guess if you like something a lot it will do that
2018/08/19, 23:00 - Jhyan: Anyway
2018/08/19, 23:00 - Jhyan: Just curious
2018/08/19, 23:03 - Adela: yeah it’s like that
2018/09/09, 12:44 - Jhyan: Ooh where are you going?
2018/09/09, 12:45 - Adela: it’s a very old picture but i wish i was going somewhere
2018/09/09, 12:45 - Jhyan: Ahh
2018/09/09, 12:45 - Jhyan: I thought that might be the case
2018/09/09, 12:45 - Adela: yeahh i couldn’t find a recent photo to use 🙈
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Adela: i’m going to cape town in two weeks so i mean, it’s not far off
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Jhyan: Smh my head I'm so disappointed
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Jhyan: Well that will be nice then
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Adela: “smh my head” 😂
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Adela: yeah hopefully
2018/09/09, 12:46 - Jhyan: It's for the added level of irony
2018/09/09, 12:47 - Adela: ooouu i get it
2018/09/17, 19:27 - Jhyan: Why do you always use a Snapchat beauty filter
2018/09/17, 19:28 - Adela: i really like the filter, idk why.
2018/09/17, 19:28 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/09/17, 19:28 - Jhyan: Well at least for me, it looks better without it
2018/09/17, 19:28 - Jhyan: It's like oversaturated I guess
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Adela: awwh thank you actually
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Adela: that’s truthful
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Jhyan: Anyway that's just me
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Adela: and i respect your opinion, thnx jhyan :)
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/09/17, 19:29 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/09/25, 13:12 - Jhyan: Those grey days when you ponder
2018/09/25, 13:12 - Jhyan: Maybe I'll write a poem inspired by the photo
2018/09/25, 13:46 - Adela: damn, didn’t know my photo was worthy of a poem written bout it
2018/09/25, 14:59 - Jhyan: Not as a standalone
2018/09/25, 14:59 - Jhyan: It's an inspiration
2018/09/25, 14:59 - Jhyan: It stirred a feeling, which is what I'm drawing from
2018/09/25, 15:00 - Jhyan: That dismal rainy day feel
2018/09/25, 15:00 - Jhyan: But the fact that it stirred that feeling is a testament to the fact that it's a good photo
2018/09/25, 15:00 - Jhyan: Despite the fact that it wasn't worthy of a poem by itself
2018/09/25, 15:07 - Adela: ohhh thanks jhyan
2018/09/25, 16:04 - Jhyan: It's my birthday today
2018/09/25, 16:05 - Adela: shit jhyan... happy birthday!!!
2018/09/25, 16:05 - Adela: how was your day?
2018/09/25, 16:05 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/09/25, 16:05 - Jhyan: Normal
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: I had an upgraded breakfast
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: And I'm going out later for dinner
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: And I got presents
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Adela: oh that’s always exciting
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Jhyan: But school was normal
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Adela: i live for going out for dinner
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Adela: anything interesting that you really wanted?
2018/09/25, 16:06 - Adela: as always
2018/09/25, 16:07 - Jhyan: No
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: that’s sad, but hopefully you enjoy your dinner today
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: It's money, a mouse, headphones and a mouse pad
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: and the rest of your day
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: Not like a specific thing I really wanted
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: i mean you can do things with money so that’s up to you
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: Not that I don't want this
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: oh yeah
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: no i completely understandable
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: It's just that it's not what you meant I thin
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: understand*
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Adela: no need to explain to me
2018/09/25, 16:08 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Adela: birthdays are filled with things you didn’t really want that much
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Adela: but sometimes you get those great gifts
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: Well you see
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: Ok wait
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: I'll be back
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Adela: my gift of choice i money so i can just get whatever i feel like with that
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Jhyan: Gtg
2018/09/25, 16:09 - Adela: okay
2018/09/25, 16:29 - Jhyan: Um
2018/09/25, 16:29 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/09/25, 16:29 - Jhyan: So
2018/09/25, 16:30 - Jhyan: I stopped following the traditional birthday model a long time ago
2018/09/25, 16:30 - Jhyan: Yeah I get you
2018/09/25, 16:31 - Jhyan: I decided it was enough because I always hated getting surprised
2018/09/25, 16:31 - Jhyan: And instead I changed it to be an ask system
2018/09/25, 16:31 - Jhyan: So like I ask for something specific now, and I can get it on my birthday
2018/09/25, 16:32 - Jhyan: Like I have a free "get me a thing I ask for card" twice a year (birthday and Christmas)
2018/09/25, 16:32 - Jhyan: And then if they really want they can throw in a surprise
2018/09/25, 16:32 - Jhyan: And also if it's too expensive or something they tell me and I'm like ok and renegotiate or delay it to a later birthday
2018/09/25, 16:33 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/09/25, 16:33 - Jhyan: But I guess surprises have their perks
2018/09/25, 16:37 - Adela: it does honestly
2018/09/25, 16:37 - Adela: you always get those bad surprises
2018/09/25, 16:37 - Jhyan: For me though, its detriments outweighed its benefits
2018/09/25, 16:38 - Jhyan: What
2018/09/25, 16:39 - Jhyan: How was _your_ day?
2018/09/25, 16:41 - Jhyan: Also when's your birthday
2018/09/25, 16:41 - Jhyan: I don't remember anyone's
2018/09/25, 17:07 - Adela: 10th march
2018/09/25, 17:08 - Adela: pretty average, flew back from cpt
2018/09/25, 17:12 - Jhyan: Ok

2018/11/01, 15:06 - Jhyan: So

2018/11/01, 15:08 - Adela: and mr murray teaches maths to those who get 70% +
2018/11/01, 15:08 - Jhyan: Oh

2019/03/17, 11:36 - Jhyan: Wait
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Jhyan: I don't know if this is right
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Jhyan: But wasn't there a mistake with one of the questions on this
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Adela: i’m not sure
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Adela: but i really can’t work this out
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Jhyan: Like even photomath can't do it
2019/03/17, 11:37 - Jhyan: Yeah I'm having trouble too
2019/03/17, 11:43 - Jhyan: No I can't get it

2019/03/17, 11:45 - Jhyan: 😂
2019/03/17, 11:45 - Jhyan: Hopefully it's just a mistake and we aren't at fault
2019/03/17, 11:52 - Adela: i remember sir did it on the board, but i can’t remember
2019/03/17, 11:53 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/22, 01:59 - Jhyan: Hey
2019/04/22, 02:00 - Jhyan: I miss when we were in the same friend group
2019/04/22, 02:00 - Jhyan: How are things?
2019/04/22, 06:37 - Adela: ahhh i miss that too
2019/04/22, 06:37 - Adela: how are things with you?
2019/04/22, 06:37 - Adela: things with me are good
2019/04/22, 06:37 - Adela: just woke up now because my whole house shook due to thunder
2019/04/22, 09:01 - Jhyan: Wow
2019/04/22, 09:02 - Jhyan: I'm really neutral
2019/04/22, 09:04 - Jhyan: I'm developing software
2019/04/22, 09:05 - Jhyan: It's called MARS, which stands for management automated recourse system
2019/04/22, 09:07 - Jhyan: It replaces management in the service industry and makes whatever store it's used in more efficient by telling the employees what to do and various other functions
2019/04/22, 10:35 - Adela: how does it work? do you install it or is it a whole machine on its own
2019/04/22, 10:40 - Jhyan: So the restaurant installs it onto their computer
2019/04/22, 10:41 - Jhyan: And then all the employees install it on their phones
2019/04/22, 10:41 - Jhyan: And it goes through a headset
2019/04/22, 10:45 - Adela: oh i see
2019/04/22, 10:45 - Adela: that’s pretty cool
2019/04/22, 10:45 - Adela: but will people lose their jobs
2019/04/22, 10:45 - Jhyan: Only management jobs
2019/04/22, 10:45 - Adela: oh i see
2019/04/22, 10:46 - Jhyan: And we're not gonna launch it here
2019/04/22, 10:46 - Jhyan: We're gonna launch it in America because there's a bigger market gap there
2019/04/22, 10:46 - Jhyan: And it doesn't have employment problems
2019/04/22, 10:46 - Jhyan: At least not like here
2019/04/22, 10:48 - Adela: oh i see because here we have huge unemployment problems so it would take make sense to introduce software that would ultimately result in the loss of jobs
2019/04/22, 10:48 - Adela: but it sounds like a really cool idea
2019/04/22, 10:48 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/22, 10:48 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/04/22, 10:48 - Jhyan: That's the logo
2019/04/22, 10:49 - Jhyan: I did it myself
2019/04/22, 10:49 - Jhyan: And most of the UI is done already
2019/04/22, 10:50 - Adela: ohh that’s really nice
2019/04/22, 10:50 - Adela: are you working on this alone
2019/04/22, 10:50 - Jhyan: No
2019/04/22, 10:50 - Jhyan: Also Sifiso
2019/04/22, 10:51 - Jhyan: But I came up with the idea, I partnered with him because he's experienced in programming and knows about startups and stuff
2019/04/22, 10:51 - Jhyan: What are you doing this holiday
2019/04/22, 10:53 - Adela: um i’m just staying at home. what about you?
2019/04/22, 10:53 - Jhyan: Same
2019/04/22, 10:53 - Adela: oh yeah sifiso is really great
2019/04/22, 10:55 - Jhyan: He talked to Jeff Diefenbach
2019/04/22, 10:55 - Jhyan: Who is a director of something at MIT
2019/04/22, 10:55 - Jhyan: And he actually raised this
2019/04/22, 11:06 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense
2019/04/22, 11:06 - Adela: oh damn
2019/04/22, 11:07 - Jhyan: Yeah I was pretty surprised
2019/04/22, 11:09 - Adela: that’s a really big person to talk to
2019/04/22, 11:10 - Jhyan: Sifiso did win the hackathon last year
2019/04/22, 11:10 - Jhyan: I'm surprised the school isn't capitalising on him
2019/04/22, 11:11 - Adela: they should actually
2019/04/22, 11:11 - Jhyan: Woah it's 11:11
2019/04/22, 11:12 - Adela: i also realised
2019/04/26, 15:24 - Jhyan: Is that you
2019/04/26, 15:24 - Adela: nooo
2019/04/26, 15:25 - Jhyan: Is it just a random picture
2019/04/26, 15:25 - Adela: yeah it is
2019/04/26, 15:25 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/04/26, 15:25 - Jhyan: Cool
2019/05/03, 19:27 - Your security code with Adela changed. Tap to learn more.
2019/05/07, 16:04 - Jhyan: What prompted this
2019/05/07, 16:36 - Adela: i’m not sure tbh
2019/05/07, 16:52 - Jhyan: I see it now and again
2019/05/07, 16:52 - Jhyan: How to you feel about school starting on Thursday
2019/05/07, 17:05 - Adela: suckish
2019/05/07, 17:05 - Jhyan: Lol
2019/05/07, 17:05 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/05/07, 17:06 - Jhyan: I'm not excited for the maths test
2019/05/07, 17:27 - Adela: it’s on monday but yeah
2019/05/07, 17:28 - Jhyan: Ik
2019/05/07, 17:44 - Adela: i’m not excited though lol
2019/05/15, 21:39 - Your security code with Adela changed. Tap to learn more.
2019/05/18, 16:03 - Jhyan: Ok this is weird but I like the wallpaper
2019/05/18, 16:20 - Adela: lol thanks. it’s probably like as old as the house
2019/05/18, 16:20 - Adela: like 100 years ?
2019/05/18, 16:20 - Jhyan: That's why I like it
2019/05/18, 16:20 - Jhyan: Woah
2019/05/18, 16:21 - Jhyan: I like those patterns
2019/05/18, 16:21 - Jhyan: From that time
2019/05/18, 16:22 - Adela: idk
2019/05/18, 16:22 - Adela: it’s gang old
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Adela: they’re pretty cool. and they’re actually textured
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Jhyan: 3D
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Adela: like the patterns are pretty 3D
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Jhyan: Like the ceilings at school
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Adela: yeah my house has only those ceilings
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Adela: well the original areas
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Adela: not the add ons
2019/05/18, 16:23 - Jhyan: That makes sense
2019/05/20, 20:38 - Jhyan: Hey
2019/05/20, 20:39 - Jhyan: You do the same subjects as me
2019/05/20, 20:39 - Jhyan: Did we have any homework
2019/05/20, 20:39 - Jhyan: I keep feeling like there's homework I've forgotten but I have no way of knowing
2019/05/20, 21:05 - Adela: me in the maths test today
2019/05/20, 21:10 - Jhyan: 😂😂😂
2019/05/20, 21:47 - Adela: uhm the business stuff, but we don’t have business today. there was IT homework and then maths (from the mind action). also AP maths
2019/05/20, 21:48 - Jhyan: Ok thanks
2019/05/20, 21:48 - Jhyan: I'll check if I've done all the maths homework
2019/05/21, 14:16 - Jhyan: I'm pretty sure it subtracts the encoding of a word from another word
2019/05/21, 14:16 - Jhyan: The sign doesn't matter
2019/05/21, 14:17 - Jhyan: The further the number from 0, the bigger the difference
2019/05/21, 14:17 - Jhyan: So a two words that give the number 32, and two words that give the number -32 have the same difference between them
2019/06/01, 23:24 - Jhyan: Wait a minute...
2019/06/01, 23:29 - Adela: what?
2019/06/01, 23:29 - Jhyan: Oh yeah lol
2019/06/01, 23:29 - Jhyan: I forgot to follow up
2019/06/01, 23:29 - Jhyan: Uh
2019/06/01, 23:30 - Jhyan: You're hair is usually darker isn't it
2019/06/01, 23:30 - Adela: the trick of lighting hehe
2019/06/01, 23:42 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/06/01, 23:42 - Jhyan: Cool
2019/06/01, 23:46 - Adela: yeah 😂😂
2019/06/04, 06:35 - Jhyan: Or... You know... Girls could just not play games and just tell us

But what do I know
2019/06/04, 07:00 - Adela: that would be preferable
2019/06/05, 18:09 - Jhyan: Do you celebrate Eid
2019/06/05, 18:09 - Jhyan: I seem to remember that
2019/06/05, 18:09 - Jhyan: But you were at school yesterday and today so I'm doubting myself
2019/06/05, 18:09 - Adela: well my family is muslim and i used to before but i have recently been distancing myself from islam and yeah
2019/06/05, 18:10 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/06/05, 18:10 - Jhyan: Is there a reason?
2019/06/05, 18:10 - Adela: the religion just doesn’t resonate with me and i wanna find myself outside of the confines of islam
2019/06/05, 18:10 - Jhyan: I'm not Islamic either, but I go for my family
2019/06/05, 18:10 - Jhyan: That's reasonable
2019/06/05, 18:14 - Adela: oh i see
2019/06/05, 18:14 - Adela: is your family muslim?
2019/06/05, 18:15 - Jhyan: Half of them
2019/06/05, 18:15 - Jhyan: Although that's not true
2019/06/05, 18:15 - Jhyan: I say half because it's my dad's side, and I have two sides, but they're bigger in numbers so technically most of my family is
2019/06/05, 18:18 - Adela: my mom’s surname is Adams actually and that’s some islamic family heritage
2019/06/05, 18:18 - Adela: i see
2019/06/05, 18:18 - Adela: my entire family is
2019/06/05, 18:19 - Jhyan: Woah
2019/06/05, 18:20 - Jhyan: We could've had almost the same surname
2019/06/05, 18:21 - Adela: yup
2019/06/05, 18:22 - Adela: i was actually supposed to be a boy (Adam Jardine)
2019/06/05, 18:22 - Jhyan: Wow now that's crazy
2019/06/05, 18:22 - Adela: yeah 😂😂
2019/06/05, 18:22 - Adela: but yeah, i could have been Adela Adams
2019/06/05, 18:22 - Jhyan: Coz my mom said she'd have probably named me Adam if my surname wasn't Adam
2019/06/05, 18:23 - Jhyan: So we could've had either the same first name or almost the same surname
2019/06/05, 18:24 - Jhyan: There's a universe in which that's true (if parallel worlds could be believed)
2019/06/05, 18:25 - Adela: i believe in parallel universes tbh
2019/06/05, 18:25 - Adela: Adam Adam
2019/06/05, 18:25 - Jhyan: It's an entertaining theory
2019/06/05, 18:26 - Jhyan: I have a joke that I could name my child Adam and give him the middle name Adam (if it's a he)
2019/06/05, 18:26 - Jhyan: Adam Adam Adam
2019/06/05, 18:26 - Adela: woah that would be really weird
2019/06/05, 18:27 - Adela: i actually have great grandparents (Gawa and Adam) and those are basically the arabic names for adam and eve so lol, that’s cool
2019/06/05, 18:27 - Jhyan: I wouldn't do it obviously 😂
2019/06/05, 18:28 - Jhyan: Yeah. Fun fact: Adam is derived from the Middle Eastern region to very old linguistics, in which that early version of Adam meant "man"
2019/06/05, 18:29 - Adela: oooh that’s cool
2019/06/05, 18:29 - Jhyan: As in human, not as in the male gender
2019/06/05, 18:29 - Jhyan: But it obviously had that connotation
2019/06/05, 18:29 - Jhyan: Because of the biblical reference
2019/06/05, 18:30 - Adela: i guess so
2019/06/08, 19:55 - Jhyan: How do you cope with school still
2019/06/08, 19:56 - Jhyan: This year is really fucking with me, because there aren't any details about tests, my studying doesn't do jack shit and I'm not even sure of how anything works anymore
2019/06/08, 19:56 - Adela: i don’t even know honestly.
2019/06/08, 19:57 - Adela: i’m also feeling that. it’s as if things are not communicated correctly, and i end up just doing more than i need to because it’s better to be more prepared
2019/06/08, 19:57 - Jhyan: Like I study for hours and I get to the test and I think I understand it, but when it gets marked and given back and I'm barely keeping above 60s
2019/06/08, 19:59 - Adela: ah shit dude, i don’t know. i’m also struggling a bit, especially with physics, my head is just not in that subject
2019/06/08, 19:59 - Jhyan: Yeah. And it's sudden. Last year they were actually helping and now they are just cutting us off out of nowhere
2019/06/08, 19:59 - Jhyan: Yeah I get good marks for physics but I don't know why
2019/06/08, 20:00 - Jhyan: Every year before this in my entire life I would know if I was getting a good or bad mark based on how I felt in the test
2019/06/08, 20:01 - Jhyan: But now I do the test and get it back and it's like someone just used a random number generator from 60 to 100 and wrote it down as my mark
2019/06/08, 20:01 - Adela: yeah but that’s what senior high is like, i guess
2019/06/08, 20:01 - Adela: i get you. i really do
2019/06/08, 20:02 - Jhyan: That's one of my theories, that they just don't really care about us anymore. But it doesn't account for why I've lost my conception of progress and knowledge
2019/06/08, 20:02 - Adela: i don’t think it’s them not caring, it’s more about preparation for university
2019/06/08, 20:03 - Jhyan: And I'm randomly panicking. For the past month I've been paranoid that there's homework I haven't done or a test I don't know about or something
2019/06/08, 20:04 - Adela: omg i feel like this too. idk what i need to do that i am not doing
2019/06/08, 20:04 - Jhyan: I get that, but the way they're doing that (if they are) is actually idiotic. Why would they just suddenly do that without warning
2019/06/08, 20:05 - Jhyan: I'm glad to hear it's not just me
2019/06/08, 20:05 - Adela: i understand
2019/06/08, 20:05 - Jhyan: In some areas, things are told to me and I don't understand it
2019/06/08, 20:05 - Adela: i’m fucking stressed abt my marks and abt assessments i am missing
2019/06/08, 20:05 - Jhyan: And when I ask questions the answers I get are even more vague
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Adela: english is also a stress this year and it never was before
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Jhyan: I had a 2 hour long argument with Mr Mohanoe about how rights don't make sense
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Adela: lol
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Adela: that day 💀
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Jhyan: And I don't know if it's just me being stupid or if people aren't explaining thongs
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Jhyan: *things
2019/06/08, 20:06 - Jhyan: Exactly
2019/06/08, 20:07 - Jhyan: It's not even just that, it's happening everywhere. Things just aren't making sense to me
2019/06/08, 20:09 - Adela: like things feel so unnecessarily complicated
2019/06/08, 20:15 - Jhyan: I'm in a split state of thinking I'm going insane, thinking I'm losing my intelligence, and thinking everyone else is just keeping things vague and confusing for no reason
2019/06/08, 20:16 - Adela: yeah i understand how you’re feeling
2019/06/08, 20:16 - Jhyan: How do you feel about AP maths, are you getting the work
2019/06/08, 20:19 - Adela: i am getting some of it
2019/06/08, 20:19 - Adela: i don’t understand how to solve complex equations
2019/06/08, 20:19 - Adela: but then i do at the same point
2019/06/08, 20:19 - Adela: time* not point
2019/06/08, 20:25 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/06/08, 20:26 - Jhyan: I know what you mean by understanding and not understanding at the same time
2019/06/08, 20:26 - Jhyan: The entire curriculum is just strange
2019/06/08, 20:27 - Jhyan: Because even though you've got subjects like AP maths, you get things like IT that's super easy
2019/06/08, 20:27 - Jhyan: And then for some reason RELO is hard work now?
2019/06/08, 20:27 - Jhyan: The entire thing feels like a joke
2019/06/08, 20:31 - Adela: yeah it is
2019/06/08, 20:35 - Jhyan: That conversation also put something into perspective: nobody in the world knows what the fuck they're doing.

 The law doesn't actually do anything, nobody or even no group of people small enough to be recognised as a group knows how the world economy works, we're driving ourselves into an extinction we have no fucking clue how to stop, we're supposed to be doing things like building a Dyson sphere, a moon base, a Mars base, clearing the debris in space to allow for us to actually be able to launch things in the future (nobody knows about this for some reason), we're spreading lies and misinformation like wildfire, there's a fucking idiot in charge of the only national superpower, and there's an evil dictator in charge of the only other nation willing to contest the former.
2019/06/08, 20:35 - Jhyan: What the fuck are we even doing
2019/06/08, 20:36 - Adela: the world is ending which is sad
2019/06/08, 20:36 - Jhyan: I know, in MULTIPLE different ways at once
2019/06/08, 20:40 - Adela: yeah which sucks because i wanna have a family of my own but i don’t wanna have kids in some fucked up world
2019/06/08, 20:40 - Jhyan: Exactly
2019/06/08, 20:41 - Jhyan: I don't even want to have a family, but I don't want the entire goddamn species to go extinct
2019/06/08, 20:41 - Adela: yeah i really don’t either
2019/06/08, 20:41 - Adela: and the whole concept of AI is pretty fucking scary
2019/06/08, 20:41 - Jhyan: I'm
2019/06/08, 20:42 - Jhyan: *I'm frustrated
2019/06/08, 20:42 - Jhyan: Yeah.
2019/06/08, 20:42 - Adela: me too
2019/06/08, 20:42 - Jhyan: Lol that's all I can say 😂
2019/06/10, 21:29 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/06/10, 21:30 - Adela: fuck. this business test.
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Jhyan: I know
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Jhyan: All of them
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Jhyan: The two maths tests next week too
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Jhyan: And the RELO assignment
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Adela: fuck
2019/06/10, 21:31 - Adela: don’t remind me 🤦🏽‍♀
2019/06/10, 21:32 - Jhyan: At least the maths hw today was way
2019/06/10, 21:32 - Adela: i still have to catch up on that other stuff from this weeknd
2019/06/10, 21:32 - Jhyan: *easy
2019/06/10, 21:32 - Jhyan: What was this?
2019/06/10, 21:33 - Adela: all these questions on google classroom
2019/06/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: Damn, I gotta go check that
2019/06/10, 21:34 - Adela: they’re so many
2019/06/14, 23:41 - Jhyan: I wonder
2019/06/14, 23:41 - Jhyan: Maybe you'd appreciate my theory
2019/06/14, 23:41 - Adela: what theory
2019/06/14, 23:41 - Jhyan: Let me find it
2019/06/14, 23:43 - Jhyan: Social people group up. Unsocial people don't. Like objects coated in glue tossed in a bucket with each other (social) and normal objects tossed in the bucket (unsocial). They stick together like this: 
S + S > S + U > U + U
Social people like to carry out their social needs and can do that with other social people. Therefore, social people will be less happy with unsocial people than with social people, and will value being sociable higher. The ones in charge, leaders or speakers, are usually social, and this is why these ideals get passed to other people.
2019/06/14, 23:43 - Jhyan: I wrote it down
2019/06/14, 23:43 - Jhyan: It's a self sustaining negative effect
2019/06/14, 23:43 - Jhyan: It keeps itself going
2019/06/14, 23:44 - Jhyan: Idk
2019/06/14, 23:48 - Jhyan: I don't know how affected you are by this hierarchy. Probably not a lot, but you're an INTJ so maybe you can see it
2019/06/15, 07:48 - Adela: i see, well in my opinion, i almost need somebody social because they can meet me halfway when it comes to communication because i tend to be kinda withdrawn so if i have a social person to bring out the social part of me then yeah
2019/06/15, 07:48 - Adela: i feel like i am introverted, but not THAT introverted because i really enjoy company
2019/06/19, 19:51 - Jhyan: Is the joke here because she got so touched she killed him or that he's been with 9 and 10 year olds?
2019/06/19, 19:53 - Adela: noooo. it’s about the rating out of 10
2019/06/19, 19:54 - Adela: so she asked if she was the only one, and he said yes because the others were 9 and 10 (out of 10)
2019/06/19, 19:54 - Jhyan: Yeah ik
2019/06/19, 19:54 - Jhyan: And so she got touched
2019/06/19, 19:54 - Jhyan: So she needs money to get bailed
2019/06/19, 19:55 - Adela: basically
2019/06/19, 19:55 - Jhyan: But that was only one of the interpretations I could see
2019/06/19, 19:55 - Adela: she asked the question, basically asking him whether he has been with other girls or if she is the one (girl) he has been with
2019/06/19, 19:55 - Jhyan: I know
2019/06/19, 19:57 - Jhyan: But there is another interpretation possible (obviously not the one intended), that the bail money is to get _him_ out of jail because he was having relationships with minors
2019/06/19, 19:57 - Adela: ooof no ways
2019/06/19, 19:58 - Jhyan: I've just been around dark jokes for too long
2019/06/19, 19:58 - Jhyan: What's worse than a baby in a dumpster?
2019/06/19, 19:58 - Adela: idk...
2019/06/19, 19:59 - Jhyan: A baby in 2 dumpsters
2019/06/19, 19:59 - Adela: OH NOOO
2019/06/19, 19:59 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/06/19, 19:59 - Jhyan: That's an example
2019/06/19, 20:03 - Adela: that joke scarred me
2019/06/19, 20:14 - Jhyan: Oof soz
2019/06/19, 20:19 - Adela: no no its fun
2019/06/19, 20:19 - Jhyan: Oh I see
2019/06/19, 20:19 - Jhyan: But it was horrifying at the same time
2019/06/19, 20:19 - Jhyan: Well then then it's a good dark joke
2019/06/19, 20:23 - Adela: i meant fine
2019/06/19, 20:23 - Adela: but it is a good joke
2019/06/19, 20:23 - Adela: but a bad one
2019/06/25, 19:25 - Adela: hi, how do you use the sitc and sict methods? like how do you write them?
2019/06/25, 20:26 - Jhyan: Uh
2019/06/25, 20:26 - Jhyan: Do you still need the information
2019/06/25, 20:26 - Adela: yup i do
2019/06/25, 20:26 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/06/25, 20:28 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2019/06/25, 20:29 - Jhyan: Selecting is just choosing the variables
2019/06/25, 20:29 - Jhyan: Initialising is actually signing the variables values
2019/06/25, 20:29 - Jhyan: In a while loop you do TC, in a do while loop you do CT
2019/06/25, 20:30 - Jhyan: T is for test, which means you test the variable with the condition (e.g.: "if (Boolean =true)")
2019/06/25, 20:31 - Jhyan: If the condition evaluates to be true, you run the commands in the loop, and then do the final step: Change
2019/06/25, 20:31 - Jhyan: This is changing the variable in some way, incrementing it, or changing it to false etc.
2019/06/25, 20:32 - Jhyan: Technically the method SITC is actually SITCTCTCTCTC...
2019/06/25, 20:32 - Jhyan: Because every time you change the variable you go back to test it and change it again
2019/06/25, 20:32 - Jhyan: Until the condition evaluates to false
2019/06/25, 20:33 - Jhyan: For a do while loop, it's SICT
2019/06/25, 20:33 - Jhyan: Which is the same thing, except it will always run a first time (because it only does the Test after it changes the variable)
2019/06/25, 20:34 - Jhyan: So AFTER it's already run through the commands in the loop, it checks if the condition evaluates to true before running the loop again
2019/06/25, 20:34 - Jhyan: I don't know if I explained it well
2019/06/25, 20:35 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/06/25, 20:35 - Adela: thank you so much jhyan ! i really appreciate it yoh
2019/06/25, 20:35 - Jhyan: No problem
2019/06/25, 20:39 - Adela: and yeah, you explained really well,
2019/06/26, 22:44 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/06/27, 05:25 - Adela: 💀💀💀
2019/07/02, 20:52 - Jhyan: Your dog looks like your cat
2019/07/03, 11:27 - Adela: that’s not my dog 😂😂
2019/07/03, 11:27 - Adela: and he doesn’t look like my cat yoh
2019/07/03, 11:30 - Jhyan: They're both golden
2019/07/08, 16:22 - Jhyan: How do you manage time in exams
2019/07/08, 16:24 - Jhyan: Do you have a method or do you just practice being fast with past papers
2019/07/08, 16:31 - Adela: i normally just try to take it slow with myself and not force myself to do too much at once
2019/07/08, 16:31 - Adela: past papers and mind maps
2019/07/08, 16:32 - Jhyan: So you're saying that going slow will make you finish the test faster
2019/07/08, 16:32 - Jhyan: It's possible. I just want to confirm that's what you mean
2019/07/08, 16:35 - Jhyan: Well thanks. I'm pretty sure this is my problem. I'm gonna time myself when I practice and stuff too
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Adela: well when it comes to exam time, idk i just generally work pretty fast
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Adela: i don’t practice exam past papers with timers and stuff
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Adela: but when i study sufficiently, i go through the paper a lot faste r
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/07/08, 16:40 - Jhyan: Well thanks
2019/07/08, 17:04 - Adela: you’re welcome
2019/07/09, 14:25 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/07/10, 16:14 - Jhyan: Did you hear what happened
2019/07/10, 16:14 - Jhyan: Nothing is changing
2019/07/10, 16:14 - Jhyan: We're still doing this written exam
2019/07/10, 16:19 - Adela: yeah i know
2019/07/10, 16:19 - Adela: it’s really frustrating
2019/07/10, 16:26 - Jhyan: We need to get higher ups involved
2019/07/10, 16:27 - Jhyan: Like Mr Purchase
2019/07/10, 16:27 - Jhyan: We're planning on going to the office tomorrow
2019/07/10, 16:27 - Jhyan: Because she can't just veto us like this when she has no arguments and we have many
2019/07/10, 16:28 - Jhyan: Just because she's HOD
2019/07/10, 16:31 - Adela: it’s really annoying
2019/07/10, 16:31 - Adela: but i don’t think there is much we can do
2019/07/10, 18:10 - Jhyan: We're organising a thing on Friday
2019/07/10, 18:10 - Jhyan: A bunch of us are gonna go to the office to complain
2019/07/10, 18:10 - Jhyan: And we need as many people as physically possible
2019/07/10, 18:11 - Jhyan: They can't reject it if there's that many of us
2019/07/11, 17:58 - Jhyan: Ooh yes The Perks of Being a Wallflower!

The book was really good
2019/07/13, 11:49 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/07/13, 11:50 - Adela: ooouu i really like this
2019/07/13, 11:50 - Adela: thank you 🖤
2019/07/13, 11:50 - Jhyan: :)
2019/07/13, 11:50 - Jhyan: Np
2019/07/25, 22:30 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/07/25, 22:30 - Jhyan: Also did you delete me or something
2019/07/25, 22:31 - Jhyan: Your profile pic is gone
2019/07/26, 06:55 - Adela: nope i didn’t
2019/07/26, 06:55 - Adela: otherwise you wouldn’t be able to see my status
2019/08/08, 21:37 - Jhyan: Nangs? 

I know it's something by Tame Impala
2019/08/08, 21:37 - Jhyan: Oh wait no it's the other one
2019/08/08, 21:38 - Jhyan: The less I know the better
2019/08/08, 21:42 - Adela: omg yes ! i can’t believe you know the song
2019/08/08, 21:43 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/09/02, 00:01 - Jhyan: Omg I love this song
2019/09/02, 00:02 - Jhyan: Tongue tied
2019/09/02, 00:02 - Jhyan: I picked it up along with a few others from a movie called Project Almanac. It had a great soundtrack
2019/09/02, 00:02 - Jhyan: Also one of my favourite movies
2019/09/02, 00:04 - Adela: it’s a really nice song actually
2019/09/02, 00:04 - Adela: what’s the movie about ?
2019/09/02, 00:04 - Jhyan: A group of friends find a time machine
2019/09/02, 00:05 - Jhyan: But it's got a good story
2019/09/02, 00:05 - Adela: oouu that’s cool actually
2019/09/02, 00:05 - Jhyan: Yeah. I don't wanna spoil it in case you wanna watch it
2019/09/02, 00:06 - Adela: i get that
2019/09/02, 00:07 - Jhyan: For some reason it's not rated proportionally to how much I enjoyed it
2019/09/02, 00:08 - Jhyan: Whenever this happens I chalk it up to critics being pretentious and judging it based on bullshit like how films should theoretically be paced or how stories are formulated
2019/09/02, 00:08 - Jhyan: If people enjoy it then it's a good movie
2019/09/02, 00:11 - Jhyan: Anyway good night I'm trying to adjust my sleep cycle back to normal before school
2019/09/02, 00:15 - Adela: good nighttt
2019/09/03, 21:13 - Jhyan: Where is this from
2019/09/03, 21:14 - Adela: euphoria
2019/09/03, 21:14 - Jhyan: Makes sense
2019/09/03, 21:15 - Jhyan: I googled the quote in the video and got that, but couldn't tell if the quote was from a famous person and used in both or if the video was directly from the show
2019/09/03, 21:16 - Adela: nah the quote is from the show
2019/09/03, 21:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/09/04, 20:19 - Jhyan: Do it ironically so they think it's ok and get fucked up
2019/09/04, 20:22 - Adela: what do you mean ? 💀💀
2019/09/04, 20:24 - Jhyan: Ok there are obvious flaws with it but basically you keep coming back, acting as if you still love them so that they think they can do whatever they want, and then leave them. The next time they try that shit they'll be burned
2019/09/04, 20:25 - Jhyan: I wasn't serious because it could end in the next partner being damaged even worse
2019/09/04, 20:26 - Adela: oh i get you
2019/09/11, 16:31 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2019/09/11, 17:00 - Jhyan: What about it don't you understand
2019/09/11, 17:01 - Jhyan: It's just simple code inside two separate methods
2019/09/11, 17:05 - Adela: actually it’s alright. my dad helped me a bit. the whole concept of methods is just pretty new to me right now
2019/09/11, 17:05 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2019/09/11, 17:05 - Adela: but thank you
2019/09/11, 17:05 - Jhyan: Sorry I just didn't know how to answer the question
2019/09/11, 17:05 - Jhyan: Np
2019/09/11, 17:06 - Jhyan: Yeah she didn't explain it very well in class yesterday
2019/09/13, 13:19 - Jhyan: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBAbm3YOlxKFr5CGvWt6X1IdAuxUZhWECCOU1RM4fR4Tkvqw/viewform
2019/09/13, 13:21 - Jhyan: https://forms.gle/J2kCbuMZn2BFwq5H7
2019/09/28, 16:47 - Jhyan: What do people do
2019/09/28, 16:55 - Adela: what do you mean ? 😂
2019/09/28, 16:59 - Jhyan: Idk
2019/09/28, 16:59 - Jhyan: What do you do
2019/09/28, 16:59 - Jhyan: Socially
2019/09/28, 16:59 - Jhyan: Outside of school
2019/09/28, 17:08 - Adela: like personally, i just hang out with people i feel comfortable around
2019/09/28, 17:08 - Adela: and eat with them 😂
2019/09/28, 17:08 - Jhyan: At restaurants
2019/09/28, 17:11 - Adela: not necessarily because those places be expensive
2019/09/28, 17:11 - Adela: but spots like burger king and that
2019/09/28, 17:11 - Jhyan: Oh yeah that's what I meant
2019/09/28, 17:12 - Adela: yeah basically that
2019/09/28, 17:59 - Adela: would it be possible for you to take pics of the maths homework for me ?
2019/09/28, 17:59 - Adela: like the textbook pages
2019/09/28, 17:59 - Adela: i left mine at home
2019/09/28, 17:59 - Adela: pretty please
2019/09/28, 18:02 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/09/28, 18:02 - Jhyan: Lol
2019/09/28, 18:02 - Jhyan: But because I'm not at home
2019/09/28, 18:02 - Adela: ahhh god
2019/09/28, 18:02 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/09/28, 18:03 - Jhyan: If you still need pictures by the time I'm at home I'll send
2019/09/28, 18:03 - Jhyan: But hopefully you can find someone who does have
2019/10/12, 11:37 - Jhyan: Someone said "hi" and I said "    " with no sound coming out my my mouth but a low pitch hiss of air
2019/10/12, 11:41 - Adela: so basically, you’re a cat 😂
2019/10/12, 11:41 - Jhyan: 😂
2019/10/22, 13:14 - Jhyan: Are you sick?
2019/10/22, 23:05 - Adela: i’ve just been at home because i had like red eyes then my vision was going but i went to the doctor and got some expensive ass eye drops which seem to be working... so i should be back tomorrow
2019/10/23, 06:16 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/11/18, 20:13 - Jhyan: Are you talking about maths
2019/11/18, 20:25 - Adela: nah physics
2019/11/18, 20:26 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/11/18, 20:26 - Jhyan: I thought it was maths coz that's tomorrow
2019/11/20, 08:03 - Jhyan: The textbook: virtual keyboards are a new wave of input devices that you can use to type!

Me:
2019/11/20, 08:04 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/11/20, 13:00 - Adela: virtual keyboards sound terrible
2019/11/20, 13:00 - Jhyan: They are
2019/11/20, 13:00 - Jhyan: They just look cool. It's why the trend didn't catch on
2019/11/23, 11:46 - Jhyan: I don't know if you're quoting something but we didn't invent language, it formed from the ability to make basic sounds with our mouths. So it wasn't like we thought about making it. We realised we could use it to alert others of danger and such by screaming loudly.

The ones that could more easily utilise language survived better so our brain started to develop more complex structures for audio communication. We didn't even have writing for thousands of years after complex language, it was just a compendium of more complicated combinations of sound.

So really we "invented" it like any animal would learn a behaviour that works, such as an Orca whale learning that a specific technique works to hunt fish better and using that and teaching it to their children.
2019/11/23, 12:05 - Adela: that’s actually really interesting. thank you
2019/11/23, 12:05 - Adela: like i just find it weird how language evolved
2019/11/23, 12:27 - Jhyan: Test
2019/11/23, 12:27 - Jhyan: *yeah
2019/11/23, 12:27 - Jhyan: It is pretty wierd
2019/11/23, 12:27 - Jhyan: Like imagine thought without language
2019/11/23, 12:27 - Jhyan: You'd only think in images and unorganised sounds
2019/11/23, 23:57 - Adela: sometimes i think in afrikaans which makes 0 sense
2019/12/02, 09:51 - Jhyan: Go winter club
2019/12/09, 20:53 - Jhyan: Me too
2019/12/09, 20:58 - Jhyan: How do you say your name properly
2019/12/09, 20:58 - Jhyan: I'll try to say it the right way, I just didn't know
2019/12/09, 21:01 - Adela: aah-dee-lah
2019/12/09, 21:01 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2019/12/09, 21:02 - Jhyan: Cool I'll say that next year
2019/12/09, 21:02 - Adela: hah thank you
2019/12/09, 21:02 - Adela: and your name actually
2019/12/09, 21:02 - Adela: idk if i say it right
2019/12/09, 21:05 - Jhyan: So in English representations of Chinese the sound is represented with a "zh" and in Russian there's a character for it: "ж" but people usually say "jee-yen" instead of "zhee-yen/"
2019/12/09, 21:05 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/12/09, 21:07 - Adela: oh that’s cool. i shall also start saying it
2019/12/09, 21:07 - Jhyan: Nice. We traded names
2019/12/13, 22:01 - Jhyan: That's stupid. She didn't hate the Fitbit thing until it exposed him? So she would've preferred that it started a secret? She hated knowing the truth?
2019/12/13, 22:27 - Adela: i think she’s talking about the connection they had due to the fitbit and how in tune they were, which turned out to be a bad thing because it caused her negative feelings. not the fitbit itself
2019/12/23, 15:12 - Jhyan: Where are you going
2019/12/23, 15:12 - Adela: cape town :)
2019/12/23, 15:22 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2020/01/10, 16:34 - Jhyan: Tell me about the books you've been reading
2020/01/10, 17:00 - Adela: i’ve honestly been terrible with my reading lately, like i need to get into it when i come back to jhb
2020/01/10, 17:00 - Adela: what about you ?
2020/01/10, 17:22 - Jhyan: I just started reading Sapiens
2020/01/10, 17:22 - Jhyan: And I'm gonna read this Malcom Gladwell book
2020/01/10, 17:22 - Jhyan: I saw a book that I seem to remember you reading, that's what sparked the question
2020/01/10, 17:27 - Adela: which book ?
2020/01/10, 17:27 - Jhyan: Americanah
2020/01/10, 17:27 - Jhyan: I could be wrong though
2020/01/10, 17:28 - Adela: yeah i did read that book. loved it
2020/01/10, 17:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/01/10, 17:28 - Jhyan: Well I was right then
2020/01/10, 17:28 - Jhyan: Remember that trilogy I told you about 2 years ago
2020/01/10, 17:28 - Jhyan: The Darkest Minds
2020/01/10, 17:29 - Jhyan: I only finished the third book about a week ago
2020/01/10, 17:30 - Adela: i vaguely remember this name actually
2020/01/10, 17:30 - Adela: how was it ?
2020/01/10, 17:36 - Jhyan: It was pretty great
2020/01/10, 17:36 - Jhyan: The author really understood pain
2020/01/10, 17:38 - Jhyan: I was able to relate to Ruby, the main character, a lot
2020/01/10, 17:38 - Jhyan: But it was also adventurous and fun
2020/01/10, 17:39 - Jhyan: And had deep and imaginable characters
2020/01/10, 17:40 - Adela: it’s always great when there is someone you can relate to in a book, makes it feel real
2020/01/10, 17:41 - Adela: think i should read it
2020/01/10, 17:44 - Jhyan: Is this a question or a statement
2020/01/10, 18:08 - Adela: it’s a statement
2020/01/10, 18:09 - Jhyan: Ah
2020/01/11, 16:28 - Jhyan: I once climbed over the school fence and started walking
2020/01/11, 17:06 - Adela: how even ?
2020/01/11, 17:06 - Jhyan: At the field
2020/01/11, 17:06 - Jhyan: I just climbed over
2020/01/11, 17:07 - Jhyan: And my dad's house is near so I was really about to just go there
2020/01/11, 17:07 - Jhyan: But then they told the teachers
2020/01/11, 17:11 - Adela: snitches get stiches
2020/01/11, 17:12 - Adela: stitches*
2020/01/11, 17:20 - Jhyan: Lol
2020/01/11, 17:20 - Jhyan: In this case the ones that snitched were also the ones who literally drove me up the wall
2020/01/11, 17:33 - Adela: that’s why i don’t like people
2020/01/21, 06:22 - Jhyan: How are you still ok in the mornings for not only AP maths but also the rest of the day
2020/02/07, 07:06 - Jhyan: Does the business studies group still exist
2020/02/07, 07:06 - Jhyan: I think I left it
2020/02/07, 07:06 - Adela: the whatsapp one ?
2020/02/07, 07:06 - Adela: we don’t use it
2020/02/07, 07:07 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/02/07, 07:07 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/02/07, 07:07 - Jhyan: Is Mr Colesky still absent
2020/02/07, 07:15 - Adela: yeah he is
2020/02/07, 07:15 - Adela: but he posted an activity
2020/02/07, 07:27 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/02/07, 07:28 - Jhyan: I was more worried about him checking what we did yesterday
2020/02/10, 21:31 - Adela: jhyan, could you PLEASE send me a picture of page 21 of the it textbook
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Adela: the exercise 3
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Adela: because i left mine at school 🥴
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Jhyan: Alright
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Adela: thank you, much appreciated
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Jhyan: What about the rest of the exercises
2020/02/10, 21:32 - Adela: nah it was just that exercise because it was for homework 🥴
2020/02/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: Is this the mind action one?
2020/02/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: Oh wait
2020/02/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: IT
2020/02/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: Lol
2020/02/10, 21:33 - Jhyan: Anytime
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Adela: yeah IT 🥴
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Adela: thank you so much, i was stressing eish
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Jhyan: We have to do 3, 4 and 6
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Adela: also are you also struggling with some of the codes
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Adela: got it, i just gotta do 6 because the rest i kinda did at school
2020/02/10, 21:34 - Jhyan: It's more just tedium
2020/02/10, 21:35 - Adela: yeah i’m not enjoying these exercises
2020/02/10, 21:35 - Jhyan: They're not satisfying like they usually are 😑
2020/02/10, 21:42 - Jhyan: See you tomorrow
2020/02/20, 20:22 - Jhyan: The traps that people fall into by  believing and regurgitating them en masse are many and varied
2020/02/20, 21:53 - Adela: i am so confused 💀
2020/02/20, 21:54 - Jhyan: Often people get stuck believing things just because they're always repeated
2020/02/20, 21:54 - Jhyan: If you stop and look you'll see so many more than unconditional love being shady
2020/02/20, 21:54 - Adela: that is very true. it doesn’t even matter about how valid something is, you just hear it often and hence believe it
2020/02/20, 21:55 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/02/20, 21:56 - Jhyan: The only pitfall is that if you start to change your thinking, everybody else starts to see you as weird or rude or wrong
2020/02/20, 21:57 - Jhyan: So you still have to act in your role
2020/02/20, 22:05 - Adela: i guess i’ve just learnt not to give a fuck at this point bout what people think. everybody thinks a lot
2020/02/20, 22:07 - Jhyan: Easier said than done when what they think changes how they physically treat you as a person.
2020/02/20, 22:07 - Jhyan: But if you can do that it's good
2020/02/20, 22:08 - Adela: i just spend my time with people who get me and who treat me well, i don’t bother with anything else. it just sorta slides off
2020/02/20, 22:08 - Adela: i used to be bothered by it, but it wasn’t getting me anywhere
and no one deserves that power over me
2020/02/20, 22:09 - Jhyan: I know that's how you're supposed to do it. I just literally have no ways of meeting new people.
2020/02/20, 22:10 - Jhyan: I have to wait until university, so that's my plan
2020/02/20, 22:13 - Adela: sometimes it’s not about meeting new people, but seeing new sides of them
2020/02/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: There's an essay due in 30 minutes?!?
2020/02/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: Jk
2020/02/26, 12:59 - Jhyan: https://purposefocuscommitment.com/the-rice-and-the-chess-board-story/
2020/02/26, 14:52 - Jhyan: What did you mean that you haven't had your natural hair
2020/02/26, 14:52 - Jhyan: You said it in your status one time
2020/02/26, 15:44 - Adela: basically i’ve been chemically straightening my hair since grade 8 and this will be the first year i’m gonna leave it natural
2020/02/26, 15:45 - Jhyan: Oh that makes sense
2020/02/26, 15:46 - Jhyan: So is it really curly
2020/02/26, 16:41 - Adela: its quite curly yes
2020/02/26, 16:45 - Jhyan: I've probably never seen it since you only came to the school in grade 8
2020/02/26, 16:45 - Jhyan: It depends on what you meant by "since grade 8"
2020/02/26, 16:45 - Adela: i straightened in feb grade 8 so in the beginning it was curly
2020/02/26, 16:46 - Jhyan: Ahh
2020/02/28, 20:08 - Jhyan: Technically the financial maths homework is due never since we don't have another period
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/02/29, 00:36 - Adela: there is one more lesson unfortunately
2020/02/29, 09:13 - Jhyan: Wait what
2020/02/29, 09:14 - Jhyan: Is it on Tuesday
2020/02/29, 09:18 - Adela: on thursday
2020/02/29, 09:18 - Jhyan: I was looking forward to not having it
2020/02/29, 18:32 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/07, 09:15 - Adela: hi i was feeling really sick yesterday and didn’t come to maths.
do you have the notes on the 5 converse theorems by any chance ? i saw that there are the 4 on the group chat, but like do you have the last one ?
2020/03/07, 09:16 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/07, 09:16 - Jhyan: I didn't send it to the group coz I forgot it was one
2020/03/07, 09:16 - Jhyan: Since it was on the next board
2020/03/07, 09:16 - Jhyan: We don't need to know proofs
2020/03/07, 09:16 - Jhyan: Also these aren't in the test
2020/03/07, 09:22 - Adela: thank you so much
2020/03/07, 09:23 - Jhyan: You're welcome
2020/03/07, 09:23 - Adela: thats great... maths is giving me stress
2020/03/10, 17:10 - Jhyan: Happy birthday
2020/03/10, 17:59 - Adela: thank you so much jhyan
2020/03/10, 18:28 - Jhyan: :)
2020/03/15, 15:36 - Jhyan: What did you get for the prac test that she emailed
2020/03/15, 15:36 - Jhyan: For IT
2020/03/15, 15:36 - Jhyan: I only got 71%, but I'm pretty sure that my program did everything that was asked
2020/03/15, 15:37 - Jhyan: She may have been matking according to specific methods of getting to the solution
2020/03/15, 15:49 - Adela: i got 88%. idk how she marked and if she was too specific
2020/03/15, 15:49 - Jhyan: Is that lower than usual
2020/03/15, 16:08 - Adela: yeah much lower
2020/03/15, 16:27 - Jhyan: Perhaps it was because she tested what happens if unintended data is inputted
2020/03/15, 16:27 - Jhyan: But we weren't expected to do that last year
2020/03/15, 16:43 - Jhyan: Let me rephrase this actually
2020/03/15, 16:43 - Jhyan: Is that mark lower than what you expected with the amount of work/quality of programming you put in
2020/03/15, 16:44 - Adela: yeah, it should have been a 90% plus
2020/03/15, 16:54 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/03/15, 16:54 - Jhyan: That's definitely a problem then
2020/03/15, 20:15 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/15, 20:15 - Jhyan: At least it might solve this
2020/03/15, 20:16 - Jhyan: Because I do agree that this year has been horrible thus far
2020/03/15, 23:03 - Adela: honestly
2020/03/15, 23:03 - Adela: it’s been so fucking terrible
2020/03/15, 23:05 - Jhyan: I feel like this shut down was a needed break
2020/03/15, 23:05 - Jhyan: Things were picking up momentum too fast
2020/03/17, 11:31 - Jhyan: Aidan says you assumed that 9873 is a term in the sequence
2020/03/17, 11:32 - Jhyan: Mr Marais said that you're never allowed to assume anything is true or false when proving
2020/03/17, 11:32 - Jhyan: Is there a reason why it's justified in this case
2020/03/17, 12:04 - Adela: you can’t assume it
2020/03/17, 12:05 - Jhyan: So what did you do
2020/03/17, 12:05 - Jhyan: If you didn't assume it
2020/03/17, 12:05 - Jhyan: You don't have to send a picture or anything
2020/03/17, 12:05 - Jhyan: I just used trial and error so I already finished the question
2020/03/17, 12:06 - Adela: technically there will always be a solution. depending on what n is equal to, you can evaluate whether they are whole numbers or not. there will always be two solutions to any quadratic equation (even if they are two non-real solutions). what you are evaluating for is whether n is equal to a whole number in any case.
so there is no assumption made
2020/03/17, 12:06 - Adela: i did the same thing that aidan did
2020/03/17, 12:06 - Jhyan: But you're assuming that it's a term in the sequence
2020/03/17, 12:07 - Adela: you’re not assuming anything. you’re solving a quadratic equation
2020/03/17, 12:07 - Jhyan: Ok I get it
2020/03/17, 12:08 - Jhyan: You're basically replicating the sequence formula and solving the values with 9873 with that
2020/03/17, 12:09 - Jhyan: Not the original sequence formula, and therefore not assuming anything even though the sequence and the equation are identical
2020/03/17, 12:09 - Adela: yes
2020/03/17, 12:09 - Jhyan: Ok thanks for explaining
2020/03/19, 08:18 - Jhyan: bruh
2020/03/19, 08:18 - Jhyan: This is the code
2020/03/19, 08:20 - Adela: be serious 😂
2020/03/19, 08:21 - Jhyan: Ik
2020/03/19, 12:09 - Jhyan: Hey Adela
2020/03/19, 12:09 - Jhyan: Do you know when the business studies assignment is due?
2020/03/19, 12:10 - Adela: it is due tomorrow at 2pm
2020/03/19, 12:54 - Jhyan: Ok thanks
2020/03/21, 18:18 - Jhyan: Is that you??
2020/03/21, 18:19 - Adela: yeah it is me
2020/03/21, 18:19 - Jhyan: I didn't know you could play
2020/03/21, 18:19 - Adela: i can kinda. learnt when i was in grade 4
2020/03/21, 18:20 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2020/03/21, 18:20 - Jhyan: Were you playing from sheet music or just from memory of the song
2020/03/21, 18:21 - Jhyan: I can only play if I learn how it goes and remember it
2020/03/21, 18:22 - Jhyan: Like I can read the sheet music but I'll play it at like 3 notes per minute
2020/03/21, 18:30 - Adela: memory of the song
2020/03/21, 18:30 - Adela: i struggle with sheet music yoh
2020/03/21, 18:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/22, 18:18 - Jhyan: Do you know where you got that top
2020/03/22, 18:19 - Adela: i got it from zara
2020/03/22, 18:19 - Jhyan: It looks really good
2020/03/22, 18:19 - Jhyan: I have a similar shirt
2020/03/22, 18:20 - Jhyan: But it doesn't have the neck part sadly
2020/03/22, 21:37 - Adela: thank you 🤍
2020/03/22, 21:37 - Adela: where is yours from ?
2020/03/22, 21:45 - Jhyan: Woolworths
2020/03/22, 21:46 - Jhyan: They were selling them two winters ago and they were really comfortable so I bought a bunch
2020/03/22, 21:46 - Jhyan: Or maybe last winter
2020/03/22, 21:47 - Jhyan: And they have some sort of thermal insulation in the fabric or something so they're good for hot and cold weather, they're multipurpose shirts
2020/03/22, 21:49 - Jhyan: I'm wearing one rn
2020/03/22, 21:52 - Adela: i haven’t been there in so long actually
2020/03/22, 21:52 - Adela: i think i have some of these from woolworths too. i need to buy more
2020/03/22, 21:52 - Adela: i like wearing them under my school clothes and stuff
2020/03/22, 21:54 - Jhyan: Yeah I do this when it's really cold
2020/05/05, 12:59 - Jhyan: Remember when I sent you that artwork
2020/05/05, 12:59 - Jhyan: You don't have to remember it
2020/05/05, 12:59 - Jhyan: https://instagram.com/by.sau?igshid=1dbb42jeskvb7
2020/05/05, 12:59 - Jhyan: I found an artist that makes similar stuff
2020/05/05, 17:48 - Adela: i remember it... it was this girl walking with a sunset in the background. i love that artwork
2020/05/05, 17:48 - Adela: i really like this
2020/05/05, 17:48 - Jhyan: Glad to hear that
2020/05/12, 16:08 - Jhyan: Wait you mean that's actually what that was
2020/05/12, 17:04 - Adela: yes it is 😂
2020/05/15, 18:14 - Jhyan: Who is this
2020/05/15, 18:17 - Adela: chloe x halle
2020/05/15, 18:17 - Jhyan: Oh thanks I'll check it out
2020/05/19, 09:32 - Jhyan: Hey so I saw your comment on the assignment. I'm just marking with the mark allocations I originally intuitively thought were on each question
2020/05/19, 09:32 - Jhyan: So like if I completely missed the point of the question I'll lose marks but if it's not long enough for these surprise allocations I'm still giving myself the marks
2020/05/19, 09:33 - Jhyan: Idk if that helps
2020/05/19, 09:41 - Adela: yeah that does help, thank you. it’s just stupid in my opinion to not give a mark allocation in the first place
2020/05/19, 09:42 - Jhyan: +1
2020/05/23, 18:54 - Your security code with Adela changed. Tap to learn more.
2020/05/29, 13:59 - Jhyan: Do you think we can only list challenges because usually the macro-environmental factors in the pestle analysis can be good or bad for the business
2020/05/29, 14:09 - Adela: well the bad would be under the challenges i guess and the good would be how the business can overcome it
2020/05/29, 14:10 - Jhyan: That implies that only challenges can come from outside factors and the business has to constantly fight to keep good effects
2020/06/09, 20:41 - Jhyan: Hi Adela,

Are you confident in how you set out your answers in 4.3 of the AP homework?
2020/06/09, 20:43 - Jhyan: Mr. Marais was doing things a certain way depending on how the questions were phrased in the video, but these questions were different, so I wasn't completely sure if I was being too careful and wasting time or not.
2020/06/09, 20:50 - Jhyan: Of course, I will ask him as well, but I just wanted to get a second opinion so that I can gauge the difficulty of the work
2020/06/10, 16:50 - Adela: let me go and check what my 4.3 looks loke and if i did actually do it
2020/06/10, 16:50 - Adela: sorry for the late response, i felt exhausted for the whole of today
2020/06/10, 16:50 - Adela: i haven’t done 4.3 yet but i should do it by tomorrow, so i will let you know
2020/06/10, 16:58 - Jhyan: No problem
2020/06/10, 16:59 - Jhyan: Ok thanks
2020/06/10, 17:02 - Adela: you’re welcome
2020/06/10, 17:02 - Adela: i’ll send it through as soon as i do it
2020/06/23, 18:16 - Jhyan: How did you find the maths test today
2020/06/23, 18:16 - Jhyan: Was it easy
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: it was alright
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: Really
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: I couldn't finish it on time
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: the one question where we had to find the equation of the circle threw me off because it never specified anything about the x-axis being the tangent
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: I was at school
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: i also couldn’t
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: Right??
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: I had the same problem with that one
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: you had the same issue
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: at least you understand too
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/23, 18:18 - Adela: because it did not say it was the only intercept or anything
2020/06/23, 18:19 - Jhyan: I could've done it but I moved on to question 6 with the ball bearings
2020/06/23, 18:19 - Adela: yeah i also moved on
2020/06/23, 18:19 - Jhyan: And I wrote like a whole 2 paragraphs of sentences justifying what I was doing
2020/06/23, 18:20 - Jhyan: Did you get a wack answer for the ball bearing one
2020/06/23, 18:21 - Adela: i can’t remember, i can go check
2020/06/23, 18:21 - Jhyan: It was 1.25 minutes per mark
2020/06/23, 18:22 - Jhyan: I remember sir saying we get 1.33 minutes per mark for AP
2020/06/23, 18:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/23, 18:23 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/06/23, 18:24 - Adela: that’s a lot yoh
2020/06/23, 18:25 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/23, 18:25 - Adela: but mine is wrong
2020/06/23, 18:26 - Jhyan: Are you sure
2020/06/23, 18:26 - Jhyan: Ours is the same except the radius
2020/06/23, 18:28 - Adela: yeah i messed up with the radius
2020/06/23, 18:32 - Jhyan: I was doubting myself because wtf is (3+3√3)²
2020/06/23, 18:43 - Adela: i think you’re write tbh
2020/06/23, 18:45 - Adela: right*
2020/06/23, 18:45 - Adela: but i think its 225/4
2020/06/23, 18:45 - Jhyan: If it's 225/4 I'm wrong though
2020/06/23, 18:46 - Adela: nah 121/4 sorry
2020/06/23, 18:46 - Jhyan: But that's still not what I got
2020/06/23, 18:48 - Jhyan: What messed me up is that I spent massive amounts of time revising Euclidean geometry only to arrive at the test with 1 Euclidean question that was easy
2020/06/23, 23:25 - Adela: i really learnt all the theorems off by heart and it was the easiest section
2020/06/23, 23:26 - Jhyan: Not only that but it's an ethereal skill you can only get with practice
2020/06/23, 23:26 - Jhyan: I only hope it will help in later assessments
2020/06/23, 23:26 - Adela: i hope so honestly
2020/06/23, 23:26 - Adela: the test was not great, i hope there’s another one that counts more towards our mark
2020/06/23, 23:27 - Jhyan: I mean we have the tutorials and stuff but yeah idk
2020/06/23, 23:27 - Jhyan: If everybody does bad on this test they'll try to weight it
2020/06/23, 23:27 - Adela: well then i hope people do badly 💀
2020/06/23, 23:28 - Jhyan: The power of a collective
2020/06/23, 23:30 - Adela: power to the people! i want better marks 💀
2020/06/29, 10:47 - Jhyan: Is it just me or are these disadvantages all the same thing but phrased differently
2020/06/29, 10:49 - Adela: they kinda are tbh
2020/07/18, 00:15 - Jhyan: Damn sometimes I get ones that like make me blind
2020/07/18, 00:16 - Jhyan: Like you know the healing tool on Photoshop or other image editing software that covers up details with surrounding area?
2020/07/18, 00:17 - Jhyan: It's basically that in a certain area so like if I line it up right it will look like a word is missing
2020/07/18, 00:17 - Jhyan: Once time I had it during an exam and I got nauseous. I told them before the exam started but they were like "you're alright just take a panado"
2020/07/18, 00:18 - Jhyan: Like it's just the page
2020/07/18, 00:18 - Jhyan: I haven't had one in a while and it seems to coincide with my depression so maybe they're over but I'm always afraid of the next one because of how horrifying they are
2020/07/18, 00:20 - Adela: shit so it seems like you really battle with them too.
2020/07/18, 00:20 - Adela: i get these ones were it’s just a throbbing on the side of the head, i’m nauseous and i can barely move. and then i have to like sit down
2020/07/18, 00:20 - Jhyan: It's like super painful
2020/07/18, 00:20 - Adela: oh my god, that sounds so hectic... how often do you get migraines?
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Jhyan: I've had mixed symptoms but they were always the blinding ones called ocular migraines
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Adela: it really is 🥴
i struggle with them a lot and pain meds don’t work a lot of the time
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Adela: i hate when they tell me to take a panado, those things literally do nothing!
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Jhyan: I had one at least once a year from like grade 7 but I think the last one was either last year or 2019
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Jhyan: Right?
2020/07/18, 00:21 - Adela: that’s really good that they haven’t happened in a while at least
2020/07/18, 00:22 - Adela: but once a year is already once a year too many
2020/07/18, 00:22 - Jhyan: The first few times it happened to me it didn't have the headache part
2020/07/18, 00:22 - Jhyan: And none of the times had the headache and the blinding at the same time
2020/07/18, 00:22 - Adela: i’m so sorry, but yeah listening to the symptoms you experienced, i can understand why you wouldn’t want another one any time soon... it sounds completely terrifying
2020/07/18, 00:22 - Jhyan: Which made it worse because I didn't feel any pain but I was losing my vision
2020/07/18, 00:23 - Jhyan: Is it always on the same side for you
2020/07/18, 00:23 - Jhyan: I think mine only got super painful twice and I had to lie down in a completely dark room to tolerate it
2020/07/18, 00:24 - Jhyan: Can you barely move because you're paralysed or does the pain spike when you do or is it too distracting or what
2020/07/18, 00:26 - Adela: like i can barely move because there is an intense throbbing one side every time i try and do anything and i have to keep my head fixated in one position otherwise it just aches everywhere
2020/07/18, 00:27 - Adela: and normally i have no choice but to lie in bed because i can’t do anything else
2020/07/18, 00:27 - Jhyan: Can you do anything while lying down?

Like can you read or look at your phone or anything?
2020/07/18, 00:27 - Adela: that must be really intense to feel, like i’ve thankfully never experienced visual loss, but i can imagine that it must be so scary
2020/07/18, 00:28 - Adela: no it normally just depends. sometimes it’s the whole head that throbs or it is directly on one side
2020/07/18, 00:28 - Adela: no i can’t do anything, like i just have to stay in one position, in the dark... i normally just go offline or put down everything i am doing
2020/07/18, 00:28 - Jhyan: This MF doctor one time said they were just normal migraines one time but I didn't believe him
2020/07/18, 00:28 - Jhyan: I'm still angry
2020/07/18, 00:29 - Jhyan: Can you think
2020/07/18, 00:30 - Jhyan: Or sleep
2020/07/18, 00:30 - Adela: that doesn’t sound really normal... losing your vision
2020/07/18, 00:30 - Adela: i can’t think or just do anything productive
2020/07/18, 00:30 - Adela: normally i pass out from like the pain or the fact that i am in one position for so long in a dark room
2020/07/18, 00:31 - Jhyan: That makes sense
2020/07/18, 00:31 - Jhyan: But I remember when I had them I couldn't fall asleep at all
2020/07/18, 00:31 - Jhyan: I was just trapped awake for hours
2020/07/18, 00:31 - Jhyan: (The ones that needed me to lie down in the dark)
2020/07/18, 00:33 - Jhyan: I could think though, so I'd just think about like the people around me and my life and idk maybe due dates/work and ideas that I had
2020/07/18, 00:37 - Adela: i guess everyone has a different experience
2020/07/18, 00:38 - Jhyan: Not everyone gets them though
2020/07/18, 00:38 - Adela: i think when i have a migraine, it’s the only time when i don’t have any thoughts in my head, because i’m naturally anxious
2020/07/18, 00:38 - Jhyan: Do you have a theory for the cause of yours?
2020/07/18, 00:38 - Adela: and then when i experience a migraine, it’s just like there is nothing in my head except this huge pain
2020/07/18, 00:39 - Jhyan: It takes up all the space
2020/07/18, 00:39 - Adela: i think a lot of it is related to light because my mom is sensitive to light and i got that from her, sometimes it’s just random as well
2020/07/18, 00:40 - Jhyan: So was it very bright every time you had them
2020/07/18, 00:40 - Jhyan: Or a certain light pattern or flashing or something
2020/07/18, 00:41 - Jhyan: Oh you said it's just random sometimes
2020/07/18, 00:42 - Adela: it’s sunlight sometimes, i can’t cope with sunlight for a long period of time or i get blinding pains in my head
2020/07/18, 00:42 - Adela: idk it feels like someone is just hitting my head on the inside or like jumbling my brain up together in the most painful way
2020/07/18, 00:42 - Adela: what do you think is the cause of yours ?
2020/07/18, 00:43 - Jhyan: This
2020/07/18, 00:43 - Jhyan: But it could've been thinking too hard or stressing as I had them during exam periods twice
2020/07/18, 00:44 - Jhyan: Or it could've been that my brain chemistry made it possible but the thinking triggered it
2020/07/18, 00:54 - Adela: i feel like stress causes a lot of other things to our bodies that we don’t really understand
2020/07/18, 00:54 - Adela: oh i see, so it was closely related to your emotions ?
2020/07/18, 00:56 - Jhyan: I don't think it was the sadness, it was just the fact that my brain was chemically imbalanced
2020/07/18, 00:56 - Jhyan: Like it wasn't a direct link
2020/07/18, 00:56 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/07/18, 00:57 - Jhyan: Maybe it was sustained lack of serotonin or whatever it was
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Jhyan: Is there anything new with you?
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Jhyan: Like just in general
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Jhyan: Besides the migraines
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Adela: oh i see, because depression is the chemical imbalance in the brain so that makes sense
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Adela: not at all, i’m just trying my best to get through the assessment week
2020/07/18, 01:02 - Adela: what about you ?
2020/07/18, 01:03 - Jhyan: Idk I guess I'm a little excited for some upcoming games

 I need to get above 80% for maths as a hard objective now so I'm kinda stressing
2020/07/18, 01:04 - Jhyan: Maybe I'll get a robot vacuum for my room if I can and then I don't have to sweep anymore
2020/07/18, 01:05 - Adela: that must be really annoying yoh. a robot vacuum would be really cool
2020/07/18, 01:05 - Adela: i’m just stressing about a lot of subjects... especially physics
2020/07/18, 01:05 - Jhyan: It's surprising how much dust there is and I even take off my shoes when going into my room
2020/07/18, 01:06 - Jhyan: But at least most of it looks like lint so it's pretty clean dust if that makes sense
2020/07/18, 01:06 - Jhyan: Physics was so confusing before chemistry
2020/07/18, 01:07 - Jhyan: I kinda hate how he jumps between ways to rationalize decisions in methods and stuff
2020/07/18, 01:07 - Jhyan: Like sometimes a certain logic can work for something but not for another thing and there's no way to know because it can logically make sense but not be right
2020/07/18, 01:11 - Adela: i guess that does make sense, in a strange way...
2020/07/18, 01:12 - Adela: chemistry is comforting. i like chemistry
2020/07/18, 01:12 - Jhyan: Do you usually stay up late?
2020/07/18, 01:12 - Adela: i’m not a huge fan of the lesson structure currently
2020/07/18, 01:12 - Adela: yes, its an issue
2020/07/18, 01:12 - Jhyan: It's reassuring that we agree
2020/07/18, 01:13 - Jhyan: How does it negatively affect you?
2020/07/18, 01:14 - Jhyan: Also that maths test on analytical geometry scared me because idk why it was hard
2020/07/18, 01:15 - Adela: it seemed pretty easy at first glance, but then it turned out to be really difficult
2020/07/18, 01:15 - Adela: i just feel like it’s self study. the solutions are there, but i don’t know why and how and there isn’t enough explanations
2020/07/18, 01:15 - Adela: like sometimes i get something wrong because of a stupid error, but sometimes i don’t understand the principles and the memo doesn’t help me understand it any better
2020/07/18, 01:15 - Jhyan: No lol I meant the staying up late
2020/07/18, 01:15 - Jhyan: How does staying up late negatively affect you
2020/07/18, 01:16 - Adela: oh damn, i totally read that wrong
2020/07/18, 01:16 - Jhyan: No worries
2020/07/18, 01:16 - Adela: like i normally wake up a little bit later because i’m just so tired all the time and i feel unmotivated for a huge portion of the day (or just the beginning of it) then i get into the swing of things at around first break.
2020/07/18, 01:17 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I get the first one
2020/07/18, 01:17 - Adela: but it’s also something i don’t feel motivated enough to correct because the time in the late nights/early mornings is most of the time i have to myself
2020/07/18, 01:17 - Jhyan: It's harder to get up
2020/07/18, 01:17 - Jhyan: And my eyes are dry
2020/07/18, 01:17 - Jhyan: Exactly
2020/07/18, 01:20 - Adela: i just feel lethargic honestly. but then i want to push myself towards doing things that are productive because i don’t want to fall behind
2020/07/18, 01:22 - Jhyan: It's like a streak
2020/07/18, 01:22 - Jhyan: Like Duolingo but in real life
2020/07/18, 01:22 - Jhyan: The falling behind thing
2020/07/18, 01:22 - Jhyan: At least that's what I thought about
2020/07/18, 01:25 - Adela: duolingo... when last?
2020/07/18, 01:25 - Adela: i fell behind last term and it was just terrible and i had to catch up during the holidays and it was so much work
2020/07/18, 01:26 - Jhyan: I learned some Japanese for fun during the holidays but then school came back and it's just too much to think about
2020/07/18, 01:56 - Adela: i honestly can’t think about anything else
2020/07/18, 01:57 - Adela: like i have a gibs lesson in the morning now and i’m just catching up on what i missed because i was focusing on work because they post some online content for us to look at
2020/07/18, 01:57 - Adela: i’ve been swamped with work and it was the last thing on my mind
2020/07/18, 01:57 - Jhyan: What's a gibs lesson
2020/07/18, 01:58 - Adela: like i don’t know if you remember there was this gordon institute of business thing that was being advertised and we had to write an essay
2020/07/18, 01:58 - Adela: so i got in
2020/07/18, 01:58 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/07/18, 01:58 - Jhyan: I hate those type of things
2020/07/18, 01:59 - Jhyan: Google just announced some other programs or something and my mom sent it to me and it seems kinda different but I don't have the commitment to do it if it's not for real marks
2020/07/18, 01:59 - Jhyan: Usually
2020/07/18, 01:59 - Adela: it’s a really interesting course honestly, i love looking at the work that the post and they use a different online interface that is so much better than google classroom
2020/07/18, 02:00 - Adela: but it’s just a lot on top of the online schooling i am trying to get a grasp on currently
2020/07/18, 02:00 - Adela: what type of programmes?
2020/07/18, 02:01 - Jhyan: Uh I don't remember that well
2020/07/18, 02:01 - Jhyan: Lemme go find it
2020/07/18, 02:02 - Jhyan: Oh yeah also I usually hate these extra course things because they are really vague on what it is and you don't know if it's your skill level or anything
2020/07/18, 02:11 - Adela: it was like at the beginning of this year
2020/07/18, 02:11 - Adela: yeah the course was vague but it’s an amazing course honestly
2020/07/18, 02:11 - Jhyan: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/google-announces-certificates-in-data-project-management-and-ux.html
2020/07/18, 02:12 - Jhyan: It's also suited to you though because didn't you want to go into that sort of field
2020/07/18, 02:13 - Jhyan: I'm not saying it's not amazing but I just might not find it so
2020/07/18, 02:13 - Jhyan: Idk exactly what my point was I wasn't just trying to argue though
2020/07/18, 02:13 - Jhyan: Anyway that's the Google thing
2020/07/18, 02:14 - Jhyan: I don't think they're actually scholarships or at least what I remembered wasn't or something
2020/07/18, 02:14 - Jhyan: Basically they made some courses on Coursera and you can do them
2020/07/18, 02:19 - Jhyan: I don't think I'm explaining my problem with them well and I can't think of a way to do it nicely without being long
2020/07/18, 02:20 - Jhyan: I'm probably gonna sleep now
2020/07/18, 02:21 - Jhyan: But it was enjoyable to talk to you
2020/07/18, 02:21 - Jhyan: Good night
2020/07/18, 02:22 - Jhyan: Or morning

But I don't get hung up on pointless technicalities like that. It's conceptually night.
2020/07/18, 02:22 - Jhyan: And good luck with the course
2020/07/18, 02:24 - Adela: i do want to get into the business field so it suits me, i really like it
2020/07/18, 02:24 - Adela: i’ll read this right now
2020/07/18, 02:24 - Adela: no no, i get where you’re coming from. i’m also not trying to argue
2020/07/18, 02:25 - Adela: don’t worry about it being long, feel free to explain yourself
2020/07/18, 02:25 - Adela: it was enjoyable to speak to you on my side as well, sleep well and goodnight/morning
2020/07/18, 02:25 - Adela: thank youu
2020/07/18, 02:25 - Jhyan: Maybe I will tomorrow or something
2020/07/18, 02:26 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/07/19, 18:01 - Jhyan: Hey Adela
2020/07/19, 18:01 - Jhyan: What's your opinion on the sudden open book "tutorial" we've been informed about
2020/07/19, 18:02 - Jhyan: Mr. Marais made a post at like 12:45 telling us about a test we have tomorrow
2020/07/19, 18:37 - Adela: i mean i don’t really mind it, considering we don’t need to study/prepare
2020/07/19, 18:38 - Adela: but it would be nice if it didn’t have a 1 hour duration, but instead was due at the end of the day or something
2020/07/19, 18:38 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/07/19, 18:38 - Jhyan: I'm just kinda worried though
2020/07/19, 18:38 - Jhyan: Like I thought I was gonna do well in the last test but then I didn't
2020/07/19, 18:39 - Jhyan: But yeah they did concretely say we don't need to
2020/07/19, 21:16 - Adela: i am also worried
2020/07/19, 21:16 - Adela: but i figure there is nothing i can really do except try my best tomorrow
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Jhyan: Sir marked the AP test btw
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Adela: i know
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Adela: got my mark back
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Jhyan: Are you satisfied with it
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Adela: yeah i really am
2020/07/19, 21:17 - Adela: are you satisfied with yours ?
2020/07/19, 21:18 - Jhyan: I don't know
2020/07/19, 21:18 - Jhyan: I got 67
2020/07/19, 21:24 - Adela: well it all depends on how you feel about it honestly
2020/07/19, 21:24 - Adela: if you feel like you did your best, then that should be good enough
2020/07/21, 13:13 - Jhyan: My response to that was going to be a question of the very philosophical meaning of a "best", and a consideration of all the factors that could indicate whether it was or not.

I really don't know if I did my best because there's no way to objectively tell and I feel like I simultaneously did my best and didn't do as much as I could've, so there's no way to subjectively tell either.
2020/07/21, 13:29 - Adela: yeah “best” is subjective
2020/07/21, 13:29 - Adela: but that’s why everyone’s best means something different to them
2020/07/21, 13:29 - Adela: sometimes things are subjective because it only relates to us
2020/07/21, 13:29 - Adela: so how do you feel like you didn’t do as much as you could’ve?
2020/07/21, 13:29 - Jhyan: The problem is that even I can't decide
2020/07/21, 13:31 - Jhyan: I feel both that I could've done more and that I did as much as I could
2020/07/21, 13:32 - Jhyan: If I try go further than that, I analyse why I came to both conclusions, and I can unpack and verify those to an extent, but they're subjective in the end
2020/07/21, 13:32 - Jhyan: And they have equal weight
2020/07/21, 13:34 - Jhyan: The way we decide which subjective reality in practice is by measuring the number of people standing with respective opinions, such as in a democracy with an electorate in the ratio of those people.

But because I'm only one person, I can't divide up my final opinion as you can in an electorate, so I just have to make no conclusion.
2020/07/21, 17:41 - Adela: i see, that’s a tough situation to be in...
2020/07/21, 17:41 - Adela: how did you find the IT prac ?
2020/07/21, 17:41 - Adela: i see... that makes sense, i mean only you know what you’re capable of
2020/07/21, 17:41 - Jhyan: I think I got it
2020/07/21, 17:42 - Adela: i understand what you’re saying
2020/07/21, 17:42 - Jhyan: My program works, but you never know because she has marked based on what the code is specifically like even after not specifying that it should be like that
2020/07/21, 17:44 - Adela: that’s what irritates me about IT, there are numerous ways to come to the same result so marking should be based on whether it does what it is supposed to do efficiently
2020/07/21, 17:44 - Jhyan: Like technically you could add field variables to the class instead of using typed methods but she might mark you wrong if that's not what she intended when writing the exam
2020/07/21, 17:45 - Jhyan: Exactly. Although sometimes we need to learn a specific method of doing things, but in those cases it must be specified how we must do it.
2020/07/21, 17:49 - Adela: exactly like: use a for loop, use a void method, just something
2020/07/21, 17:50 - Adela: that’s what’s messed up
2020/07/21, 17:51 - Jhyan: I managed to persuade her to change my mark a little bit last term using the fact that the subject is based on the final result and not the code but I still got worse marks than last year even though I didn't really make executive mistakes
2020/07/21, 17:53 - Jhyan: Like the IP laws around software are literally so broad because there are so many ways to perform a task in software. They're based on what software looks like at the end, not really the actual code.
2020/07/21, 17:54 - Adela: as long as it does what it is designed for, it should be considered okay
2020/07/21, 17:54 - Adela: yoh my marks have gone down so much for IT compared to last year
2020/07/21, 19:28 - Jhyan: Are you studying rn
2020/07/21, 19:28 - Jhyan: Or were you
2020/07/21, 19:31 - Adela: no, i’m not, i’m working on assignments currently but not right now
2020/07/21, 19:31 - Adela: studying for me starts on friday
2020/07/21, 19:31 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/07/21, 19:31 - Adela: well thursday and friday
2020/07/21, 19:31 - Jhyan: I should finish that IT assignment actually
2020/07/21, 19:32 - Adela: yeah i’m like 75% done, just have to do question 4
2020/07/21, 19:34 - Jhyan: I went through and answered all questions but only some of each so I have missing answers throughout the whole thing
2020/07/21, 19:34 - Adela: oh i see, i just tried to finish section by section
2020/07/21, 19:35 - Jhyan: Yeah isn't that interesting how people do it differently
2020/07/21, 19:35 - Adela: it is, i guess we all just do what works best for us
2020/07/21, 19:35 - Adela: i like just completing chapters and getting it over with
2020/07/21, 19:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/07/22, 10:24 - Jhyan: Have you noticed the new Google Drive predictive sentence thing
2020/07/22, 10:25 - Jhyan: It works especially well for Business Studies and IT for some reason and it makes notes like 20x easier
2020/07/22, 11:41 - Adela: i don’t think so, but like to a certain extent, i think
2020/07/22, 11:41 - Jhyan: I'm often repeating phrases like "the business operations" or whatever and it just auto-completes those
2020/07/22, 11:41 - Adela: oh yes, i think it did that for me
2020/07/22, 11:44 - Jhyan: Oh I meant Google Docs lol
2020/07/22, 11:44 - Jhyan: Not Google Drive
2020/07/22, 16:46 - Jhyan: I just remembered in the last practical IT test
2020/07/22, 16:46 - Jhyan: She told us to identify the problem with her code that she intentionally left a problem in
2020/07/22, 16:46 - Jhyan: And it wasn't on NetBeans
2020/07/22, 16:47 - Jhyan: She left out a }
2020/07/22, 16:47 - Jhyan: And I said that was that the problem was
2020/07/22, 16:47 - Jhyan: And she marked me wrong because she wanted a specific problem that was somewhere else
2020/07/22, 16:48 - Adela: i think i remember this, because i think i identified that problem too
2020/07/22, 16:48 - Adela: but i can barely remember last term
2020/07/22, 16:48 - Adela: oh i’ve seen that, it helps significantly
2020/07/23, 20:01 - Jhyan: Lose at losing?
2020/07/23, 20:02 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/07/23, 23:36 - Adela: i don’t get it 😂
2020/07/23, 23:37 - Jhyan: I guess it means what you interpret it as
2020/07/23, 23:37 - Jhyan: It could be that you lose so much that you lose at losing itself
2020/07/23, 23:38 - Jhyan: Or it could be that by losing at losing you're actually winning, so even two Ls is still a W
2020/07/23, 23:51 - Adela: that’s pretty much me
2020/07/23, 23:52 - Jhyan: I'm gonna sleep
2020/07/23, 23:52 - Jhyan: Good night
2020/07/23, 23:53 - Adela: i wish i could sleep early urgh
2020/07/23, 23:54 - Jhyan: Lmao when 24:00 is early
2020/07/23, 23:54 - Jhyan: You actually sleep early in the morning
2020/07/23, 23:59 - Adela: yeah i really do
2020/07/23, 23:59 - Adela: it’s early dude. 1am is bedtime 💀
2020/07/23, 23:59 - Adela: actually 1:30
2020/07/24, 19:22 - Jhyan: What about to children
2020/07/24, 19:23 - Jhyan: How far does it go with children
2020/07/24, 19:23 - Jhyan: Because that's not an equal relationship right there
2020/07/24, 19:24 - Jhyan: This is where each idea would get interesting imo
2020/07/24, 19:33 - Adela: not an equal relationship? what do you mean by that?
2020/07/24, 19:33 - Jhyan: That's many different things
2020/07/24, 19:34 - Jhyan: But for example, the adult has far more capability than the child
2020/07/24, 19:34 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I meant between children and parents, not other children
2020/07/24, 19:34 - Jhyan: I forgot to say that
2020/07/24, 19:36 - Jhyan: Also children can't conceptualize a lot of things that adults can, and may not act rationally, reasonably or respectfully to the adult for no reason at all
2020/07/24, 19:37 - Jhyan: And there's actual legal implications for the parent/guardian to be responsible for the child
2020/07/24, 19:37 - Jhyan: And the psychological damage that an adult could do to a child for relatively small behavioural patterns
2020/07/24, 19:41 - Jhyan: And the Magnum Opus that often breaks people's brains and Sparks the Backfire Effect:

Children never choose to live. They don't opt into the contract of life willingly. Not to mention that they don't choose the situation they're born into.
2020/07/24, 19:43 - Adela: so how would you say this relates to the concept of unconditional love?
2020/07/24, 19:44 - Jhyan: Love between the child and parental figure
2020/07/24, 19:46 - Jhyan: It's much harder to reject the notion and instead introduce that either party should set personal boundaries when it's not between equal parties
2020/07/24, 19:46 - Adela: so you think this affects the sort of love that can be felt
2020/07/24, 19:46 - Adela: but is that a role we begin to play or really love ?
2020/07/24, 19:46 - Jhyan: Wdym
2020/07/24, 21:05 - Jhyan: So you started studying today?
2020/07/24, 21:34 - Adela: yeahh i did
2020/07/24, 21:35 - Jhyan: Did you remember to hand in the IT theory thing
2020/07/24, 21:36 - Adela: yeah i handed it in yesterday
2020/07/25, 19:34 - Jhyan: Can you help me with something
2020/07/25, 19:36 - Adela: yeah of course
2020/07/25, 19:36 - Jhyan: I need the reasons for the theorems we can use to prove that four points are concyclic/that a quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral. The textbook doesn't have them and no other countries seem to use reasons to justify geometric statements from what I can tell
2020/07/25, 19:37 - Adela: alright sure... lemme go and get my book and i’ll send them through
2020/07/25, 19:37 - Jhyan: Thank you so much
2020/07/25, 19:37 - Jhyan: He made us make our lists of reasons before we learned the converse reasons and it's so frustrating
2020/07/25, 19:42 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/07/25, 19:43 - Jhyan: Thanks again
2020/07/25, 19:43 - Adela: you’re welcome
2020/07/25, 19:44 - Jhyan: Oof there was one I found after hours of digging that I asked sir about and he said we could use it that was essentially the converse of angles in the same segment
2020/07/25, 19:44 - Jhyan: I guess that one will be lost to the sands of time
2020/07/25, 19:44 - Adela: there is converse <‘s in the same segment
2020/07/25, 19:45 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/07/25, 19:45 - Jhyan: Maybe it was something else then
2020/07/25, 19:46 - Adela: yeah i remember just studying so much euclidean geometry and learning all the theories and then it was barely in that test
2020/07/25, 19:46 - Jhyan: Same
2020/07/25, 19:46 - Jhyan: That's why I couldn't finish
2020/07/25, 19:46 - Jhyan: They put problem solving style analytical circle geometry
2020/07/25, 20:43 - Adela: yeah it was really tough dude
2020/07/26, 09:35 - Jhyan: Are you writing the maths exam at school
2020/07/26, 12:21 - Adela: no i’m writing everything at home
2020/07/26, 12:22 - Jhyan: Do you find it easier at home
2020/07/26, 12:22 - Adela: not really
2020/07/26, 12:22 - Adela: but my mom has heart problems so i don’t wanna put her at risk
2020/07/26, 12:22 - Jhyan: Oh I see
2020/07/26, 12:22 - Jhyan: Understandable
2020/07/31, 12:00 - Jhyan: Did you get to do question 3
2020/07/31, 12:01 - Jhyan: It took me a while to realise that question 2 was just the pattern of 2^n and then the sum of alternating values of that
2020/07/31, 12:24 - Adela: nah i couldn’t
2020/07/31, 12:24 - Adela: i just used 4*n and then divided the tiles by 2
2020/07/31, 12:25 - Adela: like i divided all tiles by 2 to get the black tiles and then multiplied that by 4 each time
2020/07/31, 12:38 - Jhyan: Does this work
2020/07/31, 12:38 - Jhyan: Coz that's interesting
2020/07/31, 12:46 - Adela: yeah it does
2020/08/03, 10:09 - Jhyan: Are you going this workshop thing
2020/08/03, 10:09 - Jhyan: For maths
2020/08/03, 16:04 - Adela: no i’m not
2020/08/03, 16:04 - Adela: are you?
2020/08/03, 16:05 - Jhyan: I still haven't decided
2020/08/03, 16:05 - Jhyan: I don't want to but I also do at the same time
2020/08/03, 16:05 - Jhyan: Like I just don't want them to make me participate in anything
2020/08/03, 16:05 - Jhyan: If I can just watch a Google meet and then be done I'll probably do it
2020/08/03, 16:06 - Adela: i don’t know
2020/08/03, 16:06 - Adela: i’m just not eager to do school
2020/08/03, 16:07 - Jhyan: Yeah that's also why I don't want to do it. I just want to have my holiday you know
2020/08/03, 16:07 - Jhyan: They took away midterms so I was burned out for the second half of the term
2020/08/03, 18:02 - Adela: i was also really burned out
2020/08/03, 18:02 - Adela: like the term was just extremely long
2020/08/03, 18:02 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/03, 18:02 - Jhyan: At one point it felt like I was just doing the same thing every day
2020/08/03, 18:03 - Jhyan: Wake up do one of a few classes, do homework, sleep
2020/08/03, 18:30 - Adela: that was exactly me
2020/08/03, 18:30 - Adela: it felt like groundhog day
2020/08/03, 18:31 - Adela: but now i really don’t feel like putting myself through classes like that again for a while
2020/08/03, 18:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/03, 18:31 - Jhyan: That makes sense
2020/08/03, 18:33 - Jhyan: Do you think you've learned the content in the curriculum as well as you would've if there wasn't a pandemic?
2020/08/03, 18:33 - Adela: no not at all to be honest with you.
2020/08/03, 18:33 - Adela: like physics i could have learned a lot more, as well as maths, like i feel like it didn’t sink in the same way
2020/08/03, 18:33 - Adela: and you?
2020/08/03, 18:34 - Jhyan: I'm so glad I'm not the only one
2020/08/03, 18:34 - Jhyan: It was all the small things
2020/08/03, 18:34 - Jhyan: And I know that's cliched
2020/08/03, 18:35 - Jhyan: But every tiny question I asked in class was validating and forming a picture of how the maths worked in my mind
2020/08/03, 18:36 - Jhyan: And without that I had doubt constantly in my mind about whether my assumptions were correct, even though they were
2020/08/03, 18:37 - Jhyan: Those questions are not really big enough to remember/to go through the effort of going to join the meet and ask them
2020/08/03, 18:38 - Jhyan: And then lastly I can't really subconsciously gauge how well everyone else is doing so I never know when finding something hard whether I should be
2020/08/03, 18:39 - Jhyan: I agree with the physics thing too, it feels like we're behind for some reason
2020/08/03, 18:53 - Adela: i don’t really want to join the google meet and stuff because i feel like it will be mass learning and not really beneficial
2020/08/03, 18:53 - Adela: yeah i understand what you’re saying 100%
2020/08/03, 18:53 - Adela: it really does
2020/08/03, 18:55 - Jhyan: Depending on how well it's done it could be useful for me if I just watch it to confirm whether my knowledge is correct
2020/08/03, 19:11 - Adela: i see
2020/08/03, 19:11 - Adela: i don’t really want to put myself through online rn
2020/08/03, 19:11 - Jhyan: I'm not trying to convince you
2020/08/03, 19:12 - Adela: no i know you’re not, i’m not taking it as that
2020/08/04, 11:23 - Jhyan: I just got an ocular migraine rn
2020/08/04, 11:26 - Jhyan: Just when I thought I wasn't going to get them anymore
2020/08/04, 12:21 - Jhyan: I think my visit is back now
2020/08/04, 12:21 - Jhyan: How ironic
2020/08/04, 17:52 - Jhyan: Eyesight
2020/08/04, 17:52 - Adela: did you lose your eyesight again?
2020/08/04, 17:52 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/04, 17:52 - Adela: how bad was it?
2020/08/04, 17:53 - Jhyan: As bad as it always is
2020/08/04, 17:53 - Jhyan: The blind spot was bigger than usual this time
2020/08/04, 17:53 - Jhyan: But I just went to lie down and tried to meditate
2020/08/04, 17:53 - Jhyan: And took some painkillers
2020/08/04, 17:53 - Jhyan: But the headache still happened
2020/08/04, 17:55 - Adela: how did the painkillers work?
2020/08/04, 17:55 - Adela: i’m so sorry
2020/08/04, 17:56 - Jhyan: It could've been that they mitigated the pain and it would've been much worse, it could've been that they did nothing but it wasn't really that bad anyway or anywhere in between
2020/08/04, 17:56 - Jhyan: I can't really say
2020/08/04, 17:57 - Jhyan: I just thought it might be interesting to you because we talked about it before
2020/08/04, 18:05 - Adela: nah thanks for telling me... because you said you haven’t had one in a while
2020/08/04, 18:05 - Adela: do you have any idea what caused it?
2020/08/04, 18:06 - Adela: i see, so the headache itself wasn’t terrible?
2020/08/04, 18:06 - Jhyan: Maybe it's because I stayed up late
2020/08/04, 18:06 - Jhyan: Or otherwise it's because I keep worrying about having to program the app I'm making
2020/08/04, 18:07 - Adela: and you didn’t get enough sleep?
2020/08/04, 18:07 - Jhyan: I did
2020/08/04, 18:07 - Jhyan: I slept for 10 hours
2020/08/04, 18:08 - Jhyan: I guess it's not the depression thing because I haven't been like I was in at least a year
2020/08/05, 01:18 - Adela: well thats a good thing at least
2020/08/05, 01:19 - Adela: so it seems to be perhaps screen time?
2020/08/05, 10:55 - Jhyan: I don't really have anything else to do
2020/08/05, 10:57 - Jhyan: But that doesn't make sense because I've been on my computer the whole day every day since lockdown started because we do school on it
2020/08/05, 10:57 - Jhyan: And it only triggered a migraine now?
2020/08/05, 10:59 - Jhyan: Actually it's probably the exams
2020/08/05, 10:59 - Jhyan: This is the third one I've had during exams (even though it was technically after by a few days)
2020/08/05, 10:59 - Jhyan: It's probably the stress of that
2020/08/05, 12:38 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/08/06, 20:34 - Adela: yeah i have been on my screen as well
2020/08/06, 20:34 - Adela: that makes sense, so like emotional migraines, it seems
2020/08/06, 20:35 - Jhyan: Yeah my therapist also thought it was that
2020/08/06, 20:35 - Jhyan: Stress
2020/08/09, 16:04 - Jhyan: Did you see the maths average
2020/08/09, 16:05 - Adela: yeah it was 44%
2020/08/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: It seems like it's super low
2020/08/09, 16:05 - Adela: its the same percentage for matrics
2020/08/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: Isn't it normally higher though
2020/08/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: I'm basing this off of intuition though
2020/08/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: So I might just be wrong
2020/08/09, 16:06 - Adela: yeah but online schooling has been an adjustment
2020/08/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: I hypothesised the same cause
2020/08/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: But you agree it's not normal?
2020/08/09, 16:22 - Adela: it isn’t normal
2020/08/09, 21:16 - Jhyan: Do you remember them having said anything about whether Feed counts for the 7 books we're supposed to read?
2020/08/09, 21:16 - Jhyan: For English
2020/08/09, 21:18 - Adela: i dont think any setwork books count
2020/08/09, 21:19 - Jhyan: I need to read four more then
2020/08/09, 21:19 - Jhyan: If it did count I would've only had 3 left
2020/08/09, 21:37 - Adela: i think i’m done
2020/08/09, 21:39 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/08/09, 21:40 - Jhyan: I haven't found time to read
2020/08/09, 21:40 - Jhyan: I read like all of my current books at the start of the year
2020/08/09, 21:40 - Jhyan: I was busy reading one now that I started months ago
2020/08/10, 15:36 - Adela: recently i’ve been the same
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Adela: the beginning of lockdown, it was all i did honestly
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Jhyan: The first holidays?
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Adela: yeah
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Jhyan: I don't even remember what I did then
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Adela: i read like 9 books i think
2020/08/10, 15:37 - Jhyan: Wow
2020/08/10, 15:39 - Jhyan: I find that admirable
2020/08/10, 15:39 - Adela: thank you 😂
2020/08/10, 15:39 - Adela: i don’t know, i guess that i turned to books after the whole lockdown happened
2020/08/10, 15:40 - Jhyan: I used to be fast at reading
2020/08/10, 15:40 - Jhyan: I used to read many books each year
2020/08/10, 15:40 - Adela: i guess i am really fast if i am enjoying the book
2020/08/10, 15:41 - Adela: or if i am not, then i’ll go fast just to finish it because i don’t like half-reading
2020/08/10, 15:41 - Jhyan: Nice so books you semi enjoy are the slowest
2020/08/10, 15:41 - Jhyan: Interesting
2020/08/10, 15:42 - Jhyan: Well I'll definitely hit the 7 book threshold by next year
2020/08/10, 15:42 - Adela: 7 books isn’t a lot if you think about it
2020/08/10, 15:42 - Adela: yeah that’s exactly it
2020/08/10, 15:43 - Jhyan: I read 3 in like January so this is true
2020/08/10, 15:45 - Jhyan: So what have you been doing this holiday?
2020/08/10, 15:46 - Adela: well this holiday i’ve just been catching up on ap maths i missed near the end of the term because i was focused on the assessments at that time
2020/08/10, 15:46 - Adela: i’ve been watching a whole bunch of series and stuff with my parents
2020/08/10, 15:46 - Adela: i want to get around to some maths work and some writing soon
2020/08/10, 15:46 - Adela: what about you?
2020/08/10, 15:46 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I did that too for a few lessons close to the exam. I loaned time and had to repay it
2020/08/10, 15:47 - Jhyan: I've just been catching up on shows and stuff that I missed
2020/08/10, 15:47 - Jhyan: And playing some games
2020/08/10, 15:47 - Jhyan: I didn't open a single entertainment thing for like 2 weeks before the exams because I was scared I wouldn't remember stuff from learning online
2020/08/10, 15:48 - Jhyan: Maybe I'll make another artwork
2020/08/10, 15:49 - Jhyan: What kind of writing? I didn't know you wrote
2020/08/10, 16:01 - Adela: yeah because i couldn’t fit ap maths into my schedule close to the assessments
2020/08/10, 16:01 - Adela: oh i’ve also been doing that, but for me it’s been fortnite
2020/08/10, 16:01 - Adela: i have to do this too because my parents want something for the back room in our house
2020/08/10, 16:01 - Adela: yeah i write, i do poetry and i also want to write a novel
2020/08/10, 16:11 - Jhyan: That's cool. Your own house is decorated by your own artwork
2020/08/10, 16:12 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I've written a few poems before. Kinda stopped though. They were mostly about my experiences, and those are much more mundane than they used to be
2020/08/10, 16:12 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I actually wanted to try to lucid dream
2020/08/10, 16:14 - Jhyan: I tried last night but it involved an alarm that didn't go off for some reason. You're supposed to interrupt your REM sleep and then go back to sleep after waking up and sometimes it sends the brain back into dreaming but without all the locks usually imposed when sleeping.
2020/08/10, 16:14 - Jhyan: Something about a chemical that makes you awake that doesn't stop being produced
2020/08/10, 18:51 - Adela: yeah my mom likes art she has a sentimental attachment to
2020/08/10, 18:51 - Adela: poetry is quite fulfilling, i find
2020/08/10, 18:52 - Adela: that sounds like quite a bit, i’ve never had a lucid dream
2020/08/10, 18:52 - Jhyan: We've never had art in the house for some reason and I only noticed at the start of the year
2020/08/10, 18:53 - Jhyan: I wanted to get one for my room but then lockdown happened and stuff
2020/08/10, 18:53 - Jhyan: I've had them a few times
2020/08/10, 18:55 - Jhyan: I had this idea to make time pass more slowly during a lucid dream and then use it to do whatever I want with extra time
2020/08/10, 18:55 - Jhyan: I might've told you about this before
2020/08/10, 18:57 - Adela: yeah lockdown has ruined that, i think i just sort of fixed my room right before lockdown. i took the old vogue magazine i had to get for business last year and stuck pictures on the walls
2020/08/10, 18:57 - Adela: oh i see
2020/08/10, 18:57 - Adela: what would you want to do during the time?
2020/08/10, 18:58 - Jhyan: I was gonna try studying during it but I don't know if that would work
2020/08/10, 18:58 - Jhyan: Coz it would require outside materials
2020/08/10, 18:58 - Jhyan: So I guess I could use it to do other stuff
2020/08/10, 18:58 - Jhyan: Extra free time
2020/08/10, 18:59 - Jhyan: You can manipulate reality itself. It's pretty cool.
2020/08/10, 18:59 - Jhyan: Maybe simulate conversations and see how my brain simulates them and try it out irl and see how it works
2020/08/10, 18:59 - Jhyan: There's lots of possibilities
2020/08/10, 18:59 - Jhyan: I just thought of this rn
2020/08/10, 19:01 - Adela: that would be kind of tricky
2020/08/10, 19:02 - Adela: that would really cool because time would be going slower than it is in real life so production would be increased
2020/08/10, 19:02 - Adela: that sounds like a really interesting one actually
2020/08/10, 19:02 - Jhyan: Maybe I could write repositories of information and hopefully they'll persist across dreams and make sure those are correct and then use those to study
2020/08/10, 19:03 - Jhyan: Yeah but I predict there would be limit at the point that my brain would be overworking
2020/08/10, 19:05 - Jhyan: Like if I'm simulating reality at a 2:1 ratio then my brain would be working twice as hard.

Obviously it won't be simulating all of my experience, somehow the dream would cut back on things like having lower visual data to process or something, but you get the point.
2020/08/10, 19:05 - Jhyan: This is all just speculation though
2020/08/10, 19:06 - Adela: that would require them to retain in the dreams
2020/08/10, 19:07 - Adela: that does sound possible because generally sleep is required to give your mind and body a rest
2020/08/10, 19:07 - Adela: you should really try it out and see
2020/08/10, 19:07 - Jhyan: Yeah idk how it would work. Maybe my brain would keep it in its memories
2020/08/10, 19:08 - Jhyan: I've also never conceptualised the outside reality in lucid dreams
2020/08/10, 19:09 - Jhyan: I was self aware and able to comprehend that it was just a dream but I never had a thought about the world outside the dream. If that's not possible idk if I'll be able to do a lot of stuff, maybe not even the whole concept in the first place
2020/08/10, 19:17 - Adela: i have been in a dream where i realised it was a dream, but then i always feel like i have no free will
2020/08/10, 19:17 - Jhyan: What happened
2020/08/10, 19:17 - Adela: i can barely remember, i just know i knew it wasn’t real
2020/08/10, 19:17 - Jhyan: I realised I was in a dream and then realised I could do whatever I wanted and then did that
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Adela: i had like 5 dreams where i knew it was a dream and kept trying to wake up but i was stuck
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Adela: like 5 dreams in one
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Adela: where i “woke up” into a new dream
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Jhyan: Woah
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Jhyan: Inception
2020/08/10, 19:18 - Adela: yeah it reminded me of the movie
2020/08/10, 19:19 - Jhyan: Idk if you get that again try to do something
2020/08/10, 19:19 - Jhyan: I have myself powers one time
2020/08/10, 19:19 - Adela: i always have no free will in my dreams
2020/08/10, 19:19 - Jhyan: But maybe the narrative of the dream involved you "realising" that without actually realising that
2020/08/10, 19:20 - Jhyan: Like your dream avatar or whatever was saying that on a script just like all the other times it said something on a script
2020/08/10, 19:20 - Jhyan: Like if in a game you can make the player's avatar say "I'm in a video game" in the story
2020/08/10, 19:21 - Jhyan: But it won't actually be that the game avatar knows that
2020/08/10, 19:21 - Jhyan: Idk that's the possibility I thought of
2020/08/10, 19:22 - Adela: i guess dreams are just weird because i always know that they are not really real because there is always something that seems off
2020/08/10, 19:22 - Jhyan: You always know while in the dream that they're not real?
2020/08/10, 19:23 - Adela: yeah i do
2020/08/10, 19:23 - Adela: like i’m always just trying to get out of the dream
2020/08/10, 19:24 - Jhyan: I've never heard of that before
2020/08/10, 19:24 - Jhyan: Maybe you're always lucid dreaming
2020/08/10, 19:26 - Adela: perhaps that is the case
2020/08/10, 19:27 - Jhyan: Do you dream often?
2020/08/10, 19:28 - Adela: yeah i do
2020/08/10, 19:28 - Jhyan: Has this never bothered you
2020/08/10, 19:29 - Jhyan: Haven't you ever noticed that other people don't always know they're in a dream during dreams
2020/08/10, 19:29 - Jhyan: Not that it's a bad thing
2020/08/10, 19:32 - Adela: i guess that it makes it easier to differentiate between reality and dream-state
2020/08/10, 19:33 - Jhyan: Oof
2020/08/10, 19:33 - Jhyan: And then there's me
2020/08/10, 19:33 - Jhyan: Where my brain makes up scenarios in dreams just to make me think something I needed happened
2020/08/10, 19:33 - Jhyan: This one time
2020/08/10, 19:34 - Jhyan: Ok context first
2020/08/10, 19:35 - Jhyan: Basically I had lost these white earphones a long time ago prior to the dream, and I had also very recently lost these blue earphones prior to the dream
2020/08/10, 19:36 - Jhyan: So I'm going about my day later and I find the white earphones right
2020/08/10, 19:36 - Jhyan: And I'm like "great I found my old earphones now I don't have to worry about having lost the blue ones"
2020/08/10, 19:37 - Jhyan: So I go through this whole normal day
2020/08/10, 19:37 - Jhyan: Eventually I go to bed
2020/08/10, 19:37 - Jhyan: And I WAKE UP FINDING OUT THAT WHOLE DAY WAS A DREAM
2020/08/10, 19:37 - Jhyan: So I was kinda disappointed that I actually didn't find my white earphones
2020/08/10, 19:38 - Jhyan: Anyway I just do the usual routine of the day as I do, and somewhere along the line I find my blue earphones
2020/08/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: So I'm like "take that brain! You can't fool me!" and then I was relieved that I found the blue ones
2020/08/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: And then eventually I go to sleep again
2020/08/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: AND I WAKE UP FOR THE SECOND TIME WITHOUT EITHER HEADPHONES
2020/08/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: AND THIS TIME I'M IN REALITY
2020/08/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: My brain defeated me anime style
2020/08/10, 19:42 - Jhyan: My brain used to do this a lot. I would have dreams where I found stuff or did things that I wanted to or was supposed to do. And then I couldn't fully trust my memory if I was trying to remember whether I did it or not.
2020/08/10, 19:42 - Jhyan: I would be thinking "but I did do that" and then realise it was in a dream
2020/08/10, 19:46 - Adela: that’s really crazy... that had never happened to me honestly
2020/08/10, 19:46 - Adela: it seems like your dreams simulate reality
2020/08/10, 19:46 - Adela: so it was an inception type moment where you woke up into a dream
2020/08/10, 19:46 - Adela: that’s pretty scary
2020/08/10, 19:47 - Adela: the inability to differentiate between reality and dream
2020/08/10, 20:40 - Jhyan: Yeah exactly
2020/08/10, 20:40 - Jhyan: Well it sounds scarier than it is
2020/08/10, 20:41 - Jhyan: I always realise if I think consciously about it
2020/08/15, 19:15 - Jhyan: When did you start playing Fortnite
2020/08/15, 20:39 - Adela: i started like in grade 9
2020/08/15, 20:40 - Jhyan: Do you play other games?
2020/08/15, 20:40 - Adela: like sims really 😂
2020/08/15, 20:40 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I think you posted that on your status one time or something
2020/08/15, 20:40 - Adela: yeah i enjoy sims sometimes
2020/08/15, 21:26 - Jhyan: Have you ever considered trying out other games?
2020/08/15, 21:29 - Jhyan: There's a huge variety available of different things
2020/08/15, 21:30 - Jhyan: You've already proven that you enjoy two very different games, why not give others a try when you have time?
2020/08/15, 21:35 - Adela: i’m not really a gamer
2020/08/15, 21:36 - Adela: i guess i do it when i have the time, but otherwise i’m more into like reading or watching stuff
2020/08/15, 21:36 - Jhyan: I see
2020/08/15, 21:37 - Jhyan: You don't have to identify as a gamer to play games
2020/08/15, 21:37 - Jhyan: But if you enjoy other activities more that's valid
2020/08/15, 21:37 - Adela: nah i know
2020/08/15, 21:37 - Adela: but gaming just occupies a lot of time and then i get eye fatigue from the screen
2020/08/15, 21:38 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/08/15, 21:39 - Jhyan: Sometimes I'm burnt out after playing games because of the time they take
2020/08/15, 21:40 - Jhyan: Especially when I try to complete things 100% which I do a lot.
2020/08/15, 21:41 - Adela: i also try and do that
2020/08/15, 21:41 - Adela: and time goes really fast when gaming
2020/08/15, 21:44 - Jhyan: There's this one game called Factorio where you have to build a factory to automate production and you have to think about ratios and logistics management and maths or whatever and I used to stay up really late playing that
2020/08/15, 21:44 - Jhyan: Without realising it
2020/08/15, 21:45 - Jhyan: That only happens with games I really enjoy, but it relates to your point by illustrating it
2020/08/15, 21:46 - Jhyan: What type of books do you read and why do you enjoy that type?
2020/08/15, 21:47 - Jhyan: I don't really enjoy books as much as I used to and I've been trying to enjoy them again
2020/08/15, 21:51 - Adela: this sounds interesting
2020/08/15, 21:52 - Adela: yeah that’s my problem with gaming
2020/08/15, 21:52 - Adela: i love magical realism because i guess it’s just written beautifully sometimes and it brings some fantasy to reality.
like my favourite magical realism book is “the strange and beautiful sorrows of ava lavender”
2020/08/15, 21:53 - Adela: right now i’m reading a book that was written in the 1800’s and it’s quite enjoyable
2020/08/15, 21:53 - Adela: sometimes i go through phases like this
2020/08/15, 21:53 - Jhyan: Did you like writing the magical realism short story
2020/08/15, 21:55 - Jhyan: I only read one book from then and I hated having to basically translate the language structure to modern English as I was reading. But it was kinda cool to see the language from the time.
2020/08/15, 21:56 - Adela: the one i am reading is “far from the madding crowd” and it’s not too difficult for me
2020/08/15, 21:56 - Adela: i loved it
2020/08/15, 21:57 - Jhyan: I almost finished 2 books that I can remember and then just stopped. Now it's too annoying to go back because I have to either be confused at what's happening or reread a large amount
2020/08/15, 21:57 - Jhyan: What was yours about?
2020/08/15, 21:57 - Adela: it was about these people who could like see their thoughts outside of their head
2020/08/15, 21:57 - Adela: it was quite strange
2020/08/15, 21:58 - Adela: it received full marks so i guess it was alright 😂
2020/08/15, 21:58 - Adela: i hate having to reread
2020/08/15, 21:59 - Jhyan: Mine was about this guy who was studying extradimensional effects and got banished to another world through a portal doorway by a secretive and powerful governmental organisation that seems to control the gateways to different worlds because he was uncovering too much information.
2020/08/15, 22:00 - Jhyan: Well you are the expert in the field
2020/08/15, 22:01 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2020/08/15, 22:01 - Adela: that sounds really interesting actually
2020/08/15, 22:02 - Jhyan: I wasn't sure if it was magical realism as I was writing it because I guess I've been exposed to the genre before and haven't really thought of it as different from Fantasy
2020/08/15, 22:02 - Jhyan: That was my conclusion anyway
2020/08/15, 22:04 - Jhyan: I guess I would've called it Magicpunk if I had to name it to compare it to Steampunk, based on how I interpreted it. Like magic is integrated into a more modern society.
2020/08/15, 22:05 - Jhyan: Ooh actually I just remembered this one short story I read that I think would fall under the genre
2020/08/15, 22:05 - Jhyan: Well there's multiple brilliant ones that I remember
2020/08/15, 22:05 - Adela: did you get feedback from the teachers?
2020/08/15, 22:05 - Jhyan: In a book called Arcanum
2020/08/15, 22:05 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/15, 22:06 - Adela: life of pi actually falls under the genre
2020/08/15, 22:06 - Adela: is it good?
2020/08/15, 22:06 - Jhyan: I got good marks but I don't remember any specific things
2020/08/15, 22:06 - Jhyan: It's a collection of short stories
2020/08/15, 22:06 - Jhyan: But some of them are fantastic from what I remember
2020/08/15, 22:07 - Jhyan: Wait maybe I'm remembering wrong let me go find the book I'm thinking about
2020/08/15, 22:11 - Jhyan: Oh I was wrong
2020/08/15, 22:11 - Jhyan: It was called "The Mammoth Book of Sorcerer's Tales"
2020/08/15, 22:11 - Jhyan: I seem to have misplaced it
2020/08/15, 22:14 - Adela: this is an intriguing title
2020/08/15, 22:14 - Adela: oh i see
2020/08/15, 22:14 - Jhyan: I think not all of them were magical realism, just really innovative and unique ideas, some of which were magical realism
2020/08/15, 22:15 - Jhyan: But the two I remember most were if my understanding of the genre is correct
2020/08/15, 22:16 - Adela: magical realism is an incredible genre to explore but nothing is impossible when it comes to it
2020/08/15, 22:17 - Jhyan: They're a whole series apparently. "The Mammoth Book of _________"
2020/08/15, 22:17 - Jhyan: They're short story anthologies in respective genres
2020/08/15, 22:17 - Jhyan: I'm worried this was one of the books that got destroyed when my roof leaked
2020/08/15, 22:18 - Jhyan: Because I don't know if I'll find it again
2020/08/15, 22:22 - Adela: i really hope you do find it again honestly
2020/08/15, 22:23 - Adela: so you only have the one of the series,
2020/08/15, 22:23 - Jhyan: Well they're not serial, I just meant that there are a bunch of them edited by the same guy I think
2020/08/15, 22:24 - Adela: oh that makes sense
2020/08/16, 00:10 - Jhyan: Something bothered me about the cover art
2020/08/16, 00:10 - Jhyan: So I decided to look further
2020/08/16, 00:10 - Jhyan: It turns out it was actually The Mammoth Book of Dark Magic
2020/08/16, 00:10 - Jhyan: The confusion came from the fact that at least one of the short stories from this one was in the sorcerer one
2020/08/16, 00:11 - Jhyan: So yeah. This is the final name of the book
2020/08/16, 00:11 - Jhyan: It wasn't what I remembered and when I saw the other one I instantly recognised it
2020/08/16, 00:19 - Jhyan: The Infestation by Tom Holt was my favourite one. But it seems it's in French.

The second one I remember is Villagio Sogno by Richard A. Lupoff. 

I doubt there's a way to find these standalone but at least I can put names to them.
2020/08/16, 17:37 - Adela: i tend to judge books by their covers 🥴
2020/08/16, 17:38 - Adela: that’s a very different name
2020/08/16, 17:38 - Adela: what were your favourite ones about?
2020/08/16, 17:42 - Jhyan: Well it's only two words different and those words are related
2020/08/16, 17:47 - Adela: “mammoth” book is quite strange
2020/08/16, 17:48 - Jhyan: It implies large size
2020/08/16, 17:48 - Jhyan: I guess
2020/08/16, 17:48 - Adela: oh that makes sense because
2020/08/16, 17:48 - Adela: ignore the “because”
2020/08/16, 17:49 - Jhyan: So The Infestation was about a low grade magician being contracted to inspect imported barrels of liquid
2020/08/16, 17:49 - Jhyan: And it's usually a low risk job
2020/08/16, 17:49 - Jhyan: But he finds this creature (?) in one of the barrels, contaminating it
2020/08/16, 17:49 - Jhyan: And this is HIGHLY unlikely
2020/08/16, 17:50 - Jhyan: And he barely remembers the training he got when he studied to do this profession
2020/08/16, 17:50 - Jhyan: And I think something about this creature made it super duper extremely dangerous cognitively
2020/08/16, 17:50 - Jhyan: Like if you thought a certain thing you'd instantly die and it would multiply or something
2020/08/16, 17:50 - Jhyan: So this guy was freaking out
2020/08/16, 17:51 - Jhyan: And he couldn't call his superior because he was trapped
2020/08/16, 17:52 - Adela: like negative thoughts?
2020/08/16, 17:52 - Adela: naturally 😂😂😂
2020/08/16, 17:52 - Jhyan: He has to try and remember the protocol he was taught years ago and execute it perfectly with an almost 0% chance of success because he was low grade and this thing was mega powerful and needed higher grade magicians
2020/08/16, 17:52 - Jhyan: I don't remember, it could've been this
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: Anyway he eventually succeeds and then he's star struck at the end
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: And I was just blown away
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: And then the second one
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: Villaggio Sogno
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: Was about this European city that gave off Venice vibes to me
2020/08/16, 17:53 - Jhyan: Well it was set there
2020/08/16, 17:54 - Adela: star struck?
2020/08/16, 17:54 - Adela: sounds like an incredible story
2020/08/16, 17:54 - Jhyan: And there were these two teenage girls out on a trip to the main city (possibly during a celebration like a carnival or something)
2020/08/16, 17:55 - Adela: i love venice
2020/08/16, 17:55 - Jhyan: Like completely amazed and numb
2020/08/16, 17:55 - Jhyan: I guess I used it wrong, I just looked it up
2020/08/16, 17:55 - Adela: oh i see
2020/08/16, 17:55 - Jhyan: Anyway so they're going to all these different shops and stuff
2020/08/16, 17:56 - Jhyan: And eventually they get to this one magical curiosity shop with trinkets in it
2020/08/16, 17:56 - Jhyan: And it's evening by then
2020/08/16, 17:57 - Jhyan: And idk what happened but the store clerk had to go fetch something in the back but ended up cursing the girls or something
2020/08/16, 17:57 - Jhyan: And then they were taken to this white void place or room or something
2020/08/16, 17:58 - Jhyan: And time was bent, like it was going crazy and moving at different speeds or whatever
2020/08/16, 17:58 - Jhyan: And they were slowly turning to ash or crystal or something
2020/08/16, 17:58 - Jhyan: I don't really remember the details
2020/08/16, 17:58 - Jhyan: But they managed to defeat the guy and get back to reality but there was a twist ending
2020/08/16, 17:58 - Jhyan: I don't remember it as much
2020/08/16, 17:59 - Jhyan: But it was very cool
2020/08/17, 15:09 - Adela: this sounds like magical realism
2020/08/17, 15:09 - Adela: definitely
2020/08/17, 15:09 - Adela: that’s freaking crazy
2020/08/17, 15:09 - Adela: it sounds really cool
2020/08/17, 15:09 - Adela: how long were these stories in length?
2020/08/17, 16:14 - Jhyan: Um
2020/08/17, 16:15 - Jhyan: I don't think I can answer this question reliably even with a guess
2020/08/17, 16:38 - Adela: oh i see
2020/08/17, 16:38 - Adela: no pressure 😂
2020/08/18, 14:09 - Jhyan: I'm looking at these past round 2 problems for the computer Olympiad and they seem way easier than what we got in round 1
2020/08/18, 14:18 - Jhyan: Oh nvm there are more than 3 questions
2020/08/18, 15:14 - Adela: yeah that computer olympiad was really bad
2020/08/18, 15:23 - Jhyan: There's questions here with 2 dimensional problems
2020/08/18, 15:24 - Jhyan: Like a grid and you have to make a program find routes through the grid
2020/08/18, 15:24 - Jhyan: And stuff
2020/08/18, 15:24 - Jhyan: I have no idea how to even start those
2020/08/24, 12:34 - Jhyan: Did you finish all 6 English essays
2020/08/24, 16:39 - Adela: yeah i did that when we got the assignment
2020/08/24, 16:54 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/08/24, 16:55 - Jhyan: I was too exhausted so when I heard it was only for next term I decided to do it in the holidays
2020/08/24, 16:55 - Jhyan: Were you able to them in 30 minutes each
2020/08/24, 16:55 - Jhyan: Because apparently that's what we're supposed to be able to do
2020/08/24, 22:41 - Adela: yeah i think so, they were pretty short after doing the previous planning
2020/08/24, 22:46 - Jhyan: Oof I couldn't
2020/08/27, 11:04 - Jhyan: It literally rained for approximately 30 seconds at my house
2020/08/27, 11:04 - Jhyan: It was less than a minute
2020/08/27, 11:04 - Jhyan: I felt cheated
2020/08/27, 12:56 - Adela: same this side
2020/08/27, 12:56 - Adela: but i heard the rain on my roof and got excited
2020/08/27, 12:56 - Adela: rain is my favourite
2020/08/27, 15:27 - Jhyan: Was the rest of your story true
2020/08/27, 15:27 - Jhyan: Do you fear darkness
2020/08/27, 15:29 - Adela: i do fear darkness
2020/08/27, 15:29 - Jhyan: I used to
2020/08/27, 15:30 - Jhyan: I was terrified of it
2020/08/27, 15:30 - Jhyan: I don't know what changed
2020/08/27, 15:30 - Jhyan: I don't have fear that often anymore. I can get jumpscared, but not fear
2020/08/27, 15:31 - Jhyan: But I can understand that fear you have
2020/08/27, 15:31 - Adela: i outgrew it, but then i was robbed last year and since then, i can’t handle darkness, i just shake and get a panic attack
2020/08/27, 15:31 - Adela: i see
2020/08/27, 15:31 - Jhyan: Were you awake when it happened
2020/08/27, 15:33 - Jhyan: We have some motion triggered floodlights that light up if they sense movement
2020/08/27, 15:34 - Jhyan: Assuming it was a home robbery, otherwise this was a stupid question
2020/08/27, 15:34 - Adela: yeah they held me at gunpoint
2020/08/27, 15:34 - Adela: that sounds really useful actually
2020/08/27, 15:34 - Adela: i would get that in my house one day
2020/08/27, 15:35 - Jhyan: I can't imagine how that must have felt
2020/08/27, 15:36 - Adela: yeah it was terrifying, i haven’t been able to sleep in the dark since then unless i’m sharing a room
2020/08/27, 15:37 - Jhyan: Well I know I wasn't at fault or anything but I'm sorry you had to go through that
2020/08/27, 15:37 - Adela: thank you, i appreciate that
2020/09/03, 21:12 - Jhyan: Do you ever get dry eyes
2020/09/03, 21:16 - Adela: no i don’t
2020/09/03, 21:17 - Jhyan: I often get it while studying
2020/09/03, 21:19 - Adela: are you studying now?
2020/09/03, 21:20 - Jhyan: Lol no
2020/09/03, 21:20 - Jhyan: I'm just doing homework
2020/09/03, 21:20 - Jhyan: But it's kinda the same thing
2020/09/03, 21:20 - Adela: oh i see
i thought you were studyingg... i was like for WHAT
2020/09/03, 21:21 - Jhyan: I mean September exams aren't too far away -_-
2020/09/03, 21:21 - Jhyan: Sadly
2020/09/03, 22:58 - Adela: we only have english and afrikaans to do though
2020/09/04, 06:45 - Jhyan: That is true
2020/09/07, 14:28 - Jhyan: Have you done the trig tutorial
2020/09/07, 21:27 - Jhyan: Ok just tell me whether you found question 1 hard if you've done it
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Adela: sorry for not responding
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Adela: i haven’t started it yet
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Jhyan: It took Aidan and I an hour to do nothing
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Jhyan: Like we couldn't figure it out
2020/09/07, 21:28 - Adela: oh no... i think ima do it during the exam week
2020/09/07, 21:29 - Jhyan: Apparently Sifiso figured it out but he said it took him an entire day
2020/09/07, 21:29 - Jhyan: Including researching through past papers and crap
2020/09/07, 21:29 - Jhyan: It's only question 1
2020/09/07, 21:29 - Jhyan: It's a proof
2020/09/07, 21:29 - Jhyan: The rest looks doable
2020/09/07, 21:30 - Jhyan: I think Mr Marais was up to something when he made question 1 but anyway don't stress
2020/09/07, 21:30 - Jhyan: Thanks :)
2020/09/07, 21:30 - Adela: maybe it’s something we are yet to learn
2020/09/07, 21:30 - Adela: i’ll let you know when i do the tutorial even though that may be in a while
2020/09/07, 21:31 - Jhyan: The thing is sir said we can do everything except the second last question
2020/09/07, 21:31 - Jhyan: Cool 🥂
2020/09/08, 22:16 - Jhyan: Your extroverted vs introverted function was pretty evenly matched right
2020/09/08, 22:16 - Jhyan: Last year I think we did personality tests
2020/09/08, 22:17 - Jhyan: You were INTJ but you were close to being ENTJ I think
2020/09/08, 22:18 - Jhyan: Idk why I just sometimes remember it because that was the first time I definitively encountered other INTJs and I seem to remember that detail but I don't know if it's true.
2020/09/08, 22:19 - Adela: yeah i am an INTJ. more introverted than extroverted actually
2020/09/08, 22:26 - Jhyan: Was it like 45/55 though or less of an even split
2020/09/08, 22:26 - Adela: i think less of an even split
2020/09/08, 22:26 - Adela: being around people for a while drains me hectically
2020/09/08, 22:26 - Jhyan: Oh so I was wrong
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: But probably not 98% introverted like me lmao
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: According to the test
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Adela: no i don’t think that much
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: I mean it's not exactly completely accurate
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Adela: but for instance, lockdown was really nothing because i didn’t feel that need to be around people
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: I just thought it was funny that I got such a high rating
2020/09/08, 22:27 - Jhyan: Yeah same
2020/09/08, 22:28 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/08, 22:28 - Jhyan: I saw that meme a while ago
2020/09/08, 22:28 - Adela: this was really me
2020/09/08, 22:28 - Adela: that’s a really high rating
2020/09/08, 22:29 - Jhyan: I was actually happier in lockdown than in normal times
2020/09/08, 22:30 - Jhyan: Now that school is coming back I'm more agitated
2020/09/08, 22:31 - Adela: i also get headaches from it
2020/09/08, 22:32 - Jhyan: Figuratively or literally
2020/09/08, 22:33 - Adela: literally
2020/09/08, 22:33 - Jhyan: That's unfortunate
2020/09/08, 22:35 - Adela: it’s kind of okay... they go away when i get home
2020/09/08, 22:35 - Jhyan: I've never heard of something like that
2020/09/08, 22:36 - Adela: it’s really strange
2020/09/08, 22:36 - Jhyan: Have you spoken to a doctor about it or something
2020/09/08, 22:37 - Adela: no not at all
2020/09/08, 22:37 - Adela: could be lack of sleep or a lot of factors really
2020/09/08, 22:37 - Jhyan: Oh. I was gonna say what if it keeps happening in university and then at a workplace
2020/09/08, 22:37 - Jhyan: But if school isn't the only independent variable then nevermind
2020/09/08, 22:38 - Adela: i think it’s mainly having to get used to the new routine
2020/09/08, 22:39 - Jhyan: I thought you meant you've always had them
2020/09/08, 22:44 - Adela: like since the start of this term
2020/09/08, 22:55 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/09/08, 22:56 - Jhyan: Oh wow
2020/09/08, 22:57 - Jhyan: That's interesting
2020/09/09, 21:51 - Jhyan: I finished Altered Carbon
2020/09/09, 21:51 - Jhyan: The book I was reading
2020/09/09, 21:51 - Jhyan: I guess that conversation we had inspired me to actually read
2020/09/09, 23:23 - Adela: i’m really glad it inspired you like that...
i, on the other hand, have not read in a while
2020/09/09, 23:23 - Adela: how was it?
2020/09/10, 13:04 - Jhyan: How the turn tables
2020/09/10, 13:04 - Jhyan: Your earring fell out
2020/09/10, 13:04 - Jhyan: Aidan put it on your desk
2020/09/10, 13:06 - Adela: oh thank you :)
2020/09/10, 13:09 - Jhyan: It was unique. I half watched the Netflix show (which imo was a great adaptation, and a pretty impressive show besides the fact that it's an adaptation).

I sat it's unique because it was the first book I've read that seems to have a more modern take on cyberpunk as the genre. Cyberpunk was born in the 80s I think so it's usually inspired by technology or cultural influences of that time, but Altered Carbon was written in 2001 so it was a future possibility that diverged from that year and not from somewhere in the 80s if that makes sense.
2020/09/10, 13:09 - Jhyan: *said
2020/09/10, 15:14 - Jhyan: That was the main takeaway from the book for me
2020/09/10, 15:15 - Jhyan: Well actually also the "meths" which were basically immortal rich people kinda but that requires context
2020/09/10, 15:17 - Jhyan: That was kinda a long answer, but I didn't want to just say "it was good"
2020/09/10, 16:13 - Adela: it is true about adaptations never being quite as good as the book because the book can just feature so much more
that does seem like a really unique take on the whole cyperpunk genre.
2020/09/10, 16:14 - Adela: i wonder if “meths” was sort of a link to the drug meth or if that’s just coincidental
2020/09/10, 16:14 - Adela: no it’s fine.
i much rather prefer answers like this to “it was good.”
2020/09/10, 16:51 - Jhyan: Nah they explained it in the book
2020/09/10, 16:51 - Jhyan: Actually it's kinda funny, I think the author decided to rename meth itself to avoid confusion
2020/09/10, 16:51 - Jhyan: Methamphetamine became tetrameth
2020/09/10, 16:54 - Jhyan: And the meths are a group of people that are unfathomably wealthy. The name comes from Methuselah, a biblical figure that lived 969 years
2020/09/10, 16:54 - Jhyan: I had to Google it because I only remembered the word Methuselah
2020/09/10, 16:56 - Jhyan: In capability they're akin to gods. Even more so than the ultra rich right now. They were inescapable. There was a comparison between them and unstoppable natural forces such as death
2020/09/10, 20:08 - Adela: oh i see...
2020/09/10, 20:09 - Adela: i get it, this book sounds really interesting
2020/09/10, 20:09 - Adela: i had to take a nap after school so sorry for the late response
2020/09/10, 20:11 - Jhyan: Don't worry bout it
2020/09/10, 20:11 - Jhyan: I have 2 left until I'm done the 7
2020/09/10, 21:27 - Adela: oh i see
2020/09/10, 21:27 - Adela: are you trying to fit all the books into this year?
2020/09/10, 22:02 - Jhyan: Not necessarily, but I think it would work out better
2020/09/10, 22:02 - Jhyan: Then I don't have to stress about that next year
2020/09/10, 22:03 - Jhyan: Although I'll probably have to refresh myself on what I read so luckily I didn't read anything obscure
2020/09/10, 22:03 - Jhyan: You said you were done? Or almost
2020/09/10, 22:03 - Adela: i am done
2020/09/10, 22:03 - Adela: yeah i need to do this to, my brain just dumps extra info
2020/09/10, 22:04 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/10, 22:05 - Jhyan: Related; I watched Tuesday's AP maths video and I forgot how to integrate and the terms and stuff
2020/09/10, 22:06 - Jhyan: Which was annoying because then I had to conceptualise it again because it's kinda abstract
2020/09/10, 22:12 - Adela: that’s the issue with ap maths, a lot of the concepts follow on from another
2020/09/10, 22:13 - Jhyan: Why do you say that's a problem
2020/09/10, 22:26 - Jhyan: I guess it's very ominous that if you miss out on something and don't go back and learn it it will cause a cascade that obstructs later sections
2020/09/10, 22:26 - Jhyan: But that's never happened to me
2020/09/10, 22:27 - Adela: which is why i always make a note of completing all the work he gives us
2020/09/10, 22:27 - Adela: it’s a lot of pressure for a subject that doesn’t even count for marks
2020/09/10, 22:27 - Adela: like if you don’t understand or do the work then you’re screwed
2020/09/10, 22:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/10, 22:33 - Jhyan: Well I'm step into the realm of dreams, good night
2020/09/10, 22:33 - Jhyan: *gonna
2020/09/10, 22:34 - Adela: sleep well ✨
2020/09/10, 22:34 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/13, 11:50 - Jhyan: My uncle wanted to know what music I listened to one time so I played it and then he basically called it trash
2020/09/13, 11:50 - Jhyan: In the car
2020/09/13, 12:02 - Adela: my parents insult my music all the time...
2020/09/13, 12:02 - Adela: but then end up liking the song the next week
2020/09/13, 12:02 - Jhyan: Ironic
2020/09/13, 12:02 - Jhyan: I mean he didn't explicitly state that it was trash
2020/09/13, 12:03 - Jhyan: But it was implied
2020/09/13, 12:03 - Jhyan: Which is funny because a lot of my music was inspired by my other uncle, his brother's music
2020/09/13, 12:04 - Jhyan: Yeah I don't usually share my music so we all just have really different music tastes
2020/09/13, 12:30 - Adela: so he doesn’t like his brother’s taste in music?
2020/09/13, 12:30 - Adela: oh i see... my family is sort of bombarded with my music all the time
2020/09/13, 12:31 - Jhyan: Idk but it's always what gets played on road trips and weekends and stuff. And they lived in the same house until recently.
2020/09/13, 12:32 - Jhyan: He never says he doesn't like it
2020/09/13, 17:13 - Jhyan: Do you remember Tongue Tied
2020/09/13, 17:13 - Jhyan: You had it on your status once or something
2020/09/13, 17:14 - Adela: yes, yes i do
2020/09/13, 17:15 - Adela: oh i see
2020/09/13, 17:15 - Adela: how did he imply it?
2020/09/13, 17:15 - Jhyan: Do you still listen to it
2020/09/13, 17:17 - Jhyan: With me he basically wanted to skip every song. And then later I showed him a different playlist that has synthwave in it and he basically straight up said that was trash directly though. But I didn't really care about that playlist because it's mostly for background music for doing stuff, even if I do enjoy the genre.
2020/09/13, 18:40 - Adela: not as much
2020/09/13, 18:41 - Adela: i really hate it when people want to skip songs i enjoy 🥴
2020/09/13, 18:42 - Jhyan: I looked at your status like 1 microsecond after you posted it lmao
2020/09/13, 18:42 - Adela: the one i just posted 😂
2020/09/13, 18:43 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/13, 18:43 - Jhyan: I always think of this meme
2020/09/13, 18:43 - Jhyan: WhatsApp cropped the caption
2020/09/13, 18:43 - Jhyan: You have to open it
2020/09/13, 18:44 - Jhyan: Yeah 😶
2020/09/13, 18:52 - Adela: that’s crazy dude 💀💀💀
2020/09/13, 18:52 - Adela: i love this show
2020/09/13, 18:53 - Jhyan: I stopped watching it after they made it seem like he killed the landlady that he was resisting killing while under the influence of drugs
2020/09/13, 18:53 - Jhyan: I really hated that because I thought he actually did
2020/09/13, 18:54 - Jhyan: But my sister told me he didn't and I haven't gotten back to resuming it
2020/09/13, 22:03 - Adela: season 2 is really crazy... you should try and finish it when you give the chance
2020/09/13, 22:03 - Adela: get*
2020/09/13, 22:04 - Jhyan: I will
2020/09/13, 22:04 - Jhyan: Especially now that you've also told me to
2020/09/14, 12:43 - Jhyan: How did you find the exam?
2020/09/14, 12:49 - Adela: it was alright... quite a lot of writing
2020/09/14, 12:49 - Jhyan: Yeah I wasn't sure how much to write so my answers ended up being paragraphs
2020/09/14, 12:50 - Jhyan: Well I'm glad you found it alright
2020/09/14, 13:23 - Adela: how did you find it
2020/09/14, 13:25 - Jhyan: It was average. It wasn't worse than normal but it had the same annoyances that most English tests have.
2020/09/14, 13:25 - Jhyan: I also did the portrait of a loaf of bread in grade 7
2020/09/14, 13:26 - Jhyan: I also only just finished in time because I forgot the critical analysis was a thing
2020/09/14, 13:26 - Adela: the critical analysis?
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Adela: yeah i don’t enjoy most english tests
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Adela: i also remember doing it
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Jhyan: The sociopathy thing
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Jhyan: And it had grammar and stuff
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Adela: i’m confused
2020/09/14, 13:27 - Adela: oh
2020/09/14, 13:28 - Jhyan: Not wearing masks linked to sociopathic traits
2020/09/14, 13:28 - Adela: oh those questions
2020/09/14, 13:28 - Jhyan: Also I didn't answer some questions because I didn't know how
2020/09/14, 13:28 - Jhyan: It did "And" was a grammatical error
2020/09/14, 13:29 - Jhyan: But it didn't say where and I couldn't find it
2020/09/14, 13:33 - Adela: oh it was the beginning of one paragraoh
2020/09/14, 13:33 - Adela: paragraph*
2020/09/14, 13:34 - Jhyan: Was it one of those things that people usually say so it sounds correct but it's actually not
2020/09/14, 13:34 - Jhyan: Because maybe that's why I missed it
2020/09/14, 13:34 - Jhyan: Like saying "me and Jake did XYZ"
2020/09/14, 13:35 - Adela: no they began the sentence with the word “and”
2020/09/14, 13:35 - Jhyan: Oh lmao the capitalisation of the word "And" should've given it away
2020/09/14, 13:37 - Adela: yeah that’s what i think it was referring to
2020/09/16, 08:11 - Jhyan: Hey
2020/09/16, 08:11 - Jhyan: Did you sign up for this maths competition
2020/09/16, 08:12 - Jhyan: I don't remember them telling us so I don't know if I did and just forgot or if I didn't
2020/09/16, 08:12 - Adela: yeah my mom did that for me, like near the end of the holidays
2020/09/16, 08:12 - Jhyan: Strange
2020/09/16, 08:13 - Jhyan: Let me try sign up if I gave
2020/09/16, 08:13 - Jhyan: *haven't
2020/09/16, 09:01 - Adela: are you doing it?
2020/09/16, 09:02 - Jhyan: I don't know
2020/09/16, 09:02 - Jhyan: They haven't gotten back to me
2020/09/16, 09:02 - Jhyan: I hope so
2020/09/16, 09:03 - Jhyan: Do you remember them telling us about it
2020/09/16, 09:34 - Adela: i don’t
2020/09/16, 09:34 - Jhyan: My reasoning is that it had to have been online
2020/09/16, 09:35 - Jhyan: Based on the fact that your mom did it at the end of the holidays
2020/09/16, 09:35 - Jhyan: But I would've known if they told us online
2020/09/16, 09:35 - Jhyan: Or maybe not
2020/09/16, 09:35 - Jhyan: Idk my memory is bad sometimes
2020/09/16, 09:35 - Jhyan: I remember one time the school did it for us
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Adela: i don’t remember them telling us specifically but i think they were in contact with the parents
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Jhyan: You, me and Mika'il were just selected to do the Wits one
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Adela: oh i remember that
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Adela: we had to go to the physical school
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Jhyan: And I didn't sign up for that one
2020/09/16, 09:36 - Jhyan: I was taken by surprise when they just told us we're doing it one day
2020/09/16, 09:43 - Jhyan: So from the phrasing it seems like I didn't sign up
2020/09/16, 09:43 - Jhyan: But I am writing tomorrow now
2020/09/16, 10:36 - Jhyan: Aren't you scared of the upcoming year ahead of us
2020/09/16, 10:37 - Adela: not really, i guess i’m already scared for this year as it is
2020/09/16, 10:37 - Jhyan: I meant like the entire time left in school
2020/09/16, 10:37 - Jhyan: It's only like a year now
2020/09/16, 10:37 - Jhyan: Because there isn't really a term 3
2020/09/16, 10:37 - Adela: nah i’m pretty glad it’s ending soon
2020/09/16, 10:38 - Jhyan: I just feel like there's no room for mistakes
2020/09/16, 10:38 - Jhyan: Same though
2020/09/16, 10:39 - Jhyan: I guess it's kinda an irrational fear
2020/09/16, 10:40 - Jhyan: Like if I have a 2% chance of failing at a given task I actually fear it more than if I have a 20% chance sometimes
2020/09/16, 20:01 - Jhyan: Are you ready for English tomorrow
2020/09/16, 21:10 - Adela: i’m a bit scared...
and you?
2020/09/16, 21:15 - Jhyan: I couldn't focus most of this entire time for some reason
2020/09/16, 21:15 - Jhyan: I just read through my essays
2020/09/16, 21:16 - Jhyan: I can always come up with stuff though so I don't think it will be that bad, besides remembering quotes verbatim
2020/09/16, 21:16 - Jhyan: Why are you scared?
2020/09/16, 21:17 - Adela: because i guess the literature essay is quite daunting
2020/09/16, 21:17 - Adela: i doubt it will be terrible
2020/09/16, 21:17 - Jhyan: Maybe time will be a problem
2020/09/16, 21:18 - Adela: i sure hope not
2020/09/16, 21:19 - Jhyan: I'm not gonna worry about the mark allocation
2020/09/16, 21:20 - Jhyan: I'm just gonna write what I think is necessary, otherwise I'll end up over analysing what I'm doing.
2020/09/16, 22:45 - Jhyan: Good night and good luck
2020/09/17, 18:44 - Jhyan: You wanna know something
2020/09/17, 18:44 - Jhyan: That wits past paper we got today?
2020/09/17, 18:45 - Jhyan: It is almost completely IDENTICAL to the post paper for the grade 8s and 9s
2020/09/17, 18:45 - Jhyan: Almost every single question is used in both
2020/09/17, 18:45 - Jhyan: So last year's one is below our level
2020/09/17, 18:46 - Jhyan: My sister has this one and we compared them
2020/09/17, 18:46 - Jhyan: That's why this year's one was so much harder
2020/09/17, 19:15 - Adela: this years one was so terrible
2020/09/17, 19:15 - Jhyan: I couldn't do question 3
2020/09/17, 19:16 - Adela: i couldn’t do so many of the stuff
2020/09/17, 19:16 - Jhyan: Last year's one was like: what's 17×24
2020/09/17, 19:17 - Jhyan: This one was like: calculate the wave function using tensor analysis
2020/09/17, 19:17 - Adela: that’s so true 😂😂😂
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Jhyan: I hate the ones that seem like you can just factorise something out or something but you can't
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Jhyan: Like they all have the same exponent or something
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Adela: i didn’t try for some of them, just wanted to leave
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Jhyan: They just taunt you
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Jhyan: Yeah I tried until the end
2020/09/17, 19:18 - Jhyan: But I still couldn't do question 3 😂
2020/09/17, 19:19 - Adela: yeah question 3 was terrible
2020/09/17, 19:19 - Jhyan: You remember it?
2020/09/17, 19:21 - Adela: barely honestly
2020/09/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/vNTSugyS038
2020/09/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: Idk if you'd find that increasing
2020/09/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: *interesting
2020/09/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: But similar problems always come up in Olympiads
2020/09/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: So there's a thing called the chicken McNugget theorem now
2020/09/17, 19:27 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/FJtaaM7Txys
2020/09/17, 19:27 - Jhyan: This one actually explains more about how it works numerical and less about how it's just an interesting dilemma
2020/09/17, 19:28 - Jhyan: But I forgot to look it up before the test so I couldn't use it. It might've been useful in some of the questions
2020/09/17, 19:28 - Adela: this is interesting... i’ll give the video a watch soon
2020/09/17, 19:30 - Jhyan: 🥂
2020/09/17, 19:32 - Adela: this video is really interesting (watching the second one)
i’ve watched another video by this guy
2020/09/17, 19:33 - Jhyan: Vsauce2
2020/09/17, 19:34 - Jhyan: I'm glad you like it
2020/09/20, 12:49 - Jhyan: Did you see the GC post from Marais
2020/09/20, 12:49 - Jhyan: About revision webinars
2020/09/20, 12:51 - Jhyan: For maths and physics
2020/09/20, 19:52 - Jhyan: The exam week is almost over... Don't forget to do the tutorial
2020/09/20, 20:37 - Adela: thank you for the reminder
2020/09/20, 20:37 - Adela: i have 2 questions left
2020/09/20, 20:37 - Adela: yeah i did
2020/09/20, 20:37 - Jhyan: Did you do question 1
2020/09/20, 20:37 - Jhyan: I can't figure it out
2020/09/20, 20:38 - Jhyan: Are you going to do them? I'm kinda on the fence
2020/09/20, 20:42 - Jhyan: I thought they were just webinars that we can join and take notes but it seems like they're making them like a course and I don't want to have to do things, I just wanted the materials and stuff and then be able to do it on my own. It seems like they're gonna have forced engagement
2020/09/20, 20:50 - Adela: i’m actually not sure hey
2020/09/20, 20:51 - Adela: it could be beneficial for me, but idk whether i have the time right now
2020/09/20, 20:55 - Jhyan: What's eating your time?
2020/09/20, 20:55 - Jhyan: Just school itself?
2020/09/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: Nvm I figured it out
2020/09/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: That took like probably 5 hours of working if I include everything
2020/09/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: Sifiso said he took a whole day
2020/09/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: Part of which was with Aidan
2020/09/20, 21:18 - Adela: i figured it out like a couple of days ago
2020/09/20, 21:18 - Adela: i just dedicated days to the tutorial because the questions confuse me
2020/09/20, 21:18 - Adela: basically this
2020/09/20, 21:19 - Adela: the PAT is also due soonish urgh
2020/09/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: Nooo
2020/09/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: I forgot about that
2020/09/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: Well thanks for reminding me too
2020/09/20, 21:32 - Adela: you’re welcome
2020/09/20, 21:32 - Adela: phase 3 is the hard one
2020/09/20, 21:32 - Adela: especially the template she sent
2020/09/20, 21:32 - Jhyan: Isn't phase 3 just the code
2020/09/20, 21:34 - Jhyan: Oh no
2020/09/20, 21:34 - Jhyan: You have to write the algorithms in pseudocode
2020/09/20, 21:36 - Adela: it’s a whole bunch of things
2020/09/20, 21:36 - Adela: that i don’t computate
2020/09/20, 21:37 - Jhyan: I just don't get the Advanced Techniques thing
2020/09/20, 21:37 - Jhyan: But the rest looks ok
2020/09/20, 22:58 - Jhyan: Good night Adela
2020/09/20, 23:06 - Adela: i hope i can finish it pretty fast
2020/09/20, 23:06 - Adela: good night Jhyan
see you on tuesday for afrikaans lol
2020/09/20, 23:06 - Jhyan: Yeah... The final September exam
2020/09/22, 15:22 - Jhyan: Was the tutorial unusually difficult for you?
2020/09/22, 15:23 - Jhyan: I don't know if I'm crazy or overthinking it or something
2020/09/22, 21:54 - Jhyan: Nevermind, I am just overthinking it. Mr Marais said it was meant to be difficult but my brain nullified that for some reason
2020/09/24, 10:56 - Jhyan: What do you do on weekends
2020/09/24, 10:56 - Jhyan: Especially these days, with the whole virus thing
2020/09/24, 10:57 - Jhyan: Crazy, there's even a virus emoji 🦠
2020/09/24, 12:35 - Adela: the tutorial is really really difficult, i’m struggling to complete it right now
2020/09/24, 12:35 - Adela: uhm i go out sometimes, but not really, otherwise i just use it to catch up on sleep or play games
2020/09/24, 12:47 - Jhyan: Yeah we asked him about it
2020/09/24, 12:47 - Jhyan: Apparently it's because everyone did poorly on the problem solving questions in the exam
2020/09/24, 12:48 - Jhyan: The really difficult ones that need you to think out the box
2020/09/24, 12:48 - Jhyan: So now the entire tutorial is made of those
2020/09/24, 12:50 - Jhyan: I used to go to sleep late in the week and do the same thing, but I decided to try and sleep before 11 every day to see if it would make a difference and now I'm too scared to go back
2020/09/24, 12:50 - Jhyan: But yeah that sounds relaxing
2020/09/24, 13:11 - Adela: for question 5.3, did you substitute in α and β into X and Y
2020/09/24, 13:12 - Adela: it’s the worst tutorial i have ever gotten
2020/09/24, 13:12 - Adela: i sleep quite late honestly
2020/09/24, 13:12 - Jhyan: No
2020/09/24, 13:13 - Jhyan: You have to work with the thing you've proven
2020/09/24, 13:13 - Jhyan: And then use the identity
2020/09/24, 13:13 - Jhyan: I'll explain when I get home
2020/09/24, 13:13 - Jhyan: But sir practically told us how to do that one lmao
2020/09/24, 13:15 - Jhyan: This is what I thought too
2020/09/24, 13:16 - Jhyan: Or at least find the most helpful way to give you a hint if you want to figure it out yourself
2020/09/24, 13:17 - Adela: really? yoh
2020/09/24, 13:17 - Adela: thank you
2020/09/24, 13:18 - Adela: this one has really stumped me
2020/09/24, 14:34 - Jhyan: I just got home
2020/09/24, 14:34 - Jhyan: I'm gonna go check what I did now
2020/09/24, 14:36 - Adela: thank you :)
2020/09/24, 14:37 - Jhyan: Do you just want a picture or an explanation or a hint
2020/09/24, 14:37 - Adela: an explanation please
2020/09/24, 14:37 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/09/24, 14:37 - Adela: just whatever you guys got from sir
2020/09/24, 14:39 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/24, 14:39 - Jhyan: And you also have what alpha is in terms of theta
2020/09/24, 14:41 - Jhyan: So you're apparently supposed to substitute in what alpha is in terms of theta and simplify that equation until you get the term of the LHS of the identity on one side
2020/09/24, 14:42 - Jhyan: A term should show up in the form cos(X+Y) and you can expand that into the RHS of the identity
2020/09/24, 14:42 - Adela: so you’re supposed to substitute alpha and theta into X and Y ?
2020/09/24, 14:43 - Jhyan: Kinda
2020/09/24, 14:44 - Jhyan: You'll get cos(37°+theta) and then you must rewrite it in the same way that you can rewrite cos(X+Y)
2020/09/24, 14:44 - Jhyan: It's more like you're substituting the identity itself into this after changing it to be compatible
2020/09/24, 14:45 - Adela: dude... i’m sorry, but i’m still really confused
2020/09/24, 14:46 - Jhyan: I don't know how to explain it without sending a picture or being there in person
2020/09/24, 14:46 - Jhyan: I could try demonstrate the principle in a general way with a video if you want
2020/09/24, 14:47 - Adela: then is a picture ok?
2020/09/24, 14:47 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/09/24, 14:47 - Jhyan: I just wasn't sure if you would want that
2020/09/24, 14:48 - Adela: at this point, i am desperate
2020/09/24, 14:48 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/24, 14:50 - Jhyan: The blue square is just manipulating the equation so that the numerator becomes the term that it's in the form cos(X+Y)

The red star is the step where you replace that term with the alternate form given by the identity's RHS: 

cosX•cosY - sinX•sinY
2020/09/24, 14:55 - Jhyan: Don't worry about it, literally everyone is struggling with this tutorial.

Also you've already done questions of this difficulty level in the exams last term. I asked sir if those were the same level as this tutorial and he said yes. 

I didn't struggle with those exam questions so I think it's just that we aren't used to getting them one after another.
2020/09/24, 15:06 - Adela: yeah the exam was a lot better than this tutorial
2020/09/24, 15:06 - Adela: it’s just really hard
2020/09/24, 15:07 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Adela: why did you say that that was all equal to 10/15
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Adela: thank you so much for your help, jhyan :)
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Jhyan: Anytime
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Adela: i really appreciate it
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Jhyan: I did like 2 steps in 2
2020/09/24, 15:08 - Jhyan: *1
2020/09/24, 15:09 - Jhyan: It's basically the triangle thing
2020/09/24, 15:09 - Jhyan: Actually no
2020/09/24, 15:09 - Jhyan: Lemme just write it
2020/09/24, 15:09 - Adela: and how did you go straight to saying 37° without θ
2020/09/24, 15:10 - Jhyan: It's the identity
2020/09/24, 15:10 - Adela: the identity is really confusing
2020/09/24, 15:10 - Jhyan: The identity splits up (X+Y) into separate terms
2020/09/24, 15:11 - Jhyan: I know I really hate trigonometry because we just have to memorize stuff even though we don't understand how it actually works. No other topic needs us to just know a formula without us understanding it
2020/09/24, 15:12 - Adela: trigonometry is really confusing
2020/09/24, 15:12 - Adela: oh i understand what you did
2020/09/24, 15:13 - Adela: thank youuu
2020/09/24, 15:13 - Jhyan: I'm just writing this
2020/09/24, 15:13 - Jhyan: Wait no
2020/09/24, 15:13 - Jhyan: This
2020/09/24, 15:15 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/09/24, 15:16 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/09/24, 15:16 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/09/24, 15:17 - Jhyan: I messed up
2020/09/24, 15:18 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/24, 15:19 - Adela: thank you, it’s cool, i’ll work out the rest for myself but i understand the concept now
2020/09/24, 15:20 - Jhyan: Good luck
2020/09/24, 15:20 - Jhyan: :)
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Adela: i finished the tutorial... thank you!!!
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Jhyan: Well done!
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Adela: do you have any idea what we’re actually supposed to put in the phase 3 doc under each heading
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Adela: because phase 3 is confusing me
2020/09/24, 19:15 - Jhyan: I asked her in class
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Jhyan: Advanced techniques is just anything you did that is higher than grade 11 level
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Adela: what if there isn’t anything
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Jhyan: So if you used a multidimensional array or something
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Jhyan: Then you don't have to do it
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Adela: oh i see
2020/09/24, 19:16 - Adela: externally sourced code?
2020/09/24, 19:17 - Jhyan: And the libraries/external code is just imports that we haven't used I think
2020/09/24, 19:17 - Jhyan: Or it could be imports that aren't part of default Java
2020/09/24, 19:18 - Jhyan: In python, there's an import for Tensorflow, which is an AI thing made by Google
2020/09/24, 19:18 - Adela: so again, if you didn’t use externally sourced stuff then you can just keep it out
2020/09/24, 19:18 - Adela: oh i see
2020/09/24, 19:19 - Jhyan: And it isn't part of default python, which is what I think is the equivalent of what would go there
2020/09/24, 19:19 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/24, 19:19 - Adela: i feel like we just got the templates but there isn’t enough info
2020/09/24, 19:20 - Jhyan: Yeah it's kinda confusing
2020/09/24, 19:20 - Jhyan: But it isn't the final so she will tell you if you do something wrong and you can edit the document
2020/09/24, 19:22 - Adela: yeah that helps
2020/09/24, 19:22 - Adela: but i still haven’t gotten coherent feedback abt phase 2
2020/09/24, 19:22 - Jhyan: She left comments on my Google Doc
2020/09/24, 19:23 - Jhyan: And the critical algorithms just looks like the important processed but with in pseudocode
2020/09/24, 19:25 - Adela: oh i see
2020/09/24, 19:25 - Adela: mine was a pdf so she didn’t do anything
2020/09/24, 19:26 - Jhyan: I think I did my phase 2 the way she wanted because she only wrote minor fixes
2020/09/24, 19:26 - Adela: yeah same with my phase 1
2020/09/24, 19:26 - Jhyan: So you can ask if you're still confused later
2020/09/24, 19:26 - Jhyan: Oh I see. We have time in class that you can ask her directly too
2020/09/24, 19:51 - Adela: i will utilise that time
2020/09/24, 19:52 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/28, 15:21 - Jhyan: Damn I actually saw you walking without it but I figured you just put it in your bag
2020/09/29, 15:05 - Jhyan: Don't forget it again 🙃
2020/09/29, 19:19 - Adela: ahhh thank you, i remembered to bring it home and it is now in the wash
2020/09/29, 19:19 - Adela: sorry for not responding also, it’s been a tough couple of days
2020/09/29, 19:19 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/09/29, 19:19 - Jhyan: I know there's been a lot of work
2020/09/29, 19:20 - Adela: and just emotionally, not been the greatest 💀
2020/09/29, 19:20 - Jhyan: I'm sorry to hear that
2020/09/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: Do you want to talk about it
2020/09/29, 19:21 - Adela: nah nah not really, but thank you
2020/09/29, 19:22 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/09/29, 19:23 - Jhyan: Thanks for the tip earlier about submitting multiple responses
2020/09/29, 19:23 - Jhyan: I probably would've given in and just done it once fearing I'd mess up the system somehow
2020/09/29, 19:23 - Jhyan: For the food on Friday
2020/09/29, 19:28 - Adela: that’s what i did because i want to have the option to have more than one boerewors roll
2020/09/29, 19:28 - Adela: so no problem
2020/09/29, 19:29 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/29, 22:07 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙
2020/09/29, 22:07 - Adela: good night jhyan ✨
2020/09/30, 16:09 - Jhyan: Did you do the AP yet
2020/09/30, 16:10 - Jhyan: It involves combinations which I remember you saying you liked
2020/09/30, 16:15 - Adela: i haven’t done it yet... combinations are really tricky
2020/09/30, 20:00 - Jhyan: Do you actually prefer counting principles or was I remembering wrong
2020/09/30, 20:01 - Adela: i don’t enjoy counting principles
2020/09/30, 20:01 - Adela: i enjoy probability though so that ends up falling under probability
2020/09/30, 20:01 - Jhyan: Oh maybe that's it
2020/09/30, 20:01 - Adela: but you’re not incorrect in saying this
2020/09/30, 20:01 - Jhyan: Maybe I was projecting also because I enjoy them
2020/09/30, 20:02 - Jhyan: Ok now I'm confused
2020/09/30, 20:02 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/01, 14:58 - Jhyan: Sorry about your desk in physics
2020/10/01, 15:03 - Jhyan: Maybe it's nothing, I just kinda felt bad
2020/10/01, 15:04 - Adela: oh no, don’t worry about it. i didn’t mind sitting next to khanya
2020/10/01, 15:18 - Jhyan: This message only went through now
2020/10/01, 15:18 - Jhyan: Ok cool I'm glad
2020/10/01, 20:41 - Adela: nah it’s no big deal, jhyan
2020/10/01, 20:42 - Adela: do you remember how sir did 7.b) in that ap maths exercise?
2020/10/01, 20:42 - Adela: the one you asked him about?
2020/10/01, 21:07 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/01, 21:07 - Jhyan: Sorry
2020/10/01, 21:08 - Jhyan: I was playing piano
2020/10/01, 21:08 - Jhyan: Do you still need help
2020/10/01, 21:10 - Jhyan: Basically he got the chance of picking a diamond (13/52) and multiplied it by itself 4 times and then by the chance of not red (39/52) and then multiplied that by the number of ways you can arrange 5 things with 4 repetitions (5C4)
2020/10/01, 21:11 - Jhyan: Actually thank you for asking because I wasn't too sure about it until I explained it rn
2020/10/01, 21:11 - Jhyan: I hope I wasn't too late to help
2020/10/01, 21:18 - Adela: yeah
2020/10/01, 21:18 - Adela: no, no problem... i just moved onto core maths in the meanwhile and left the question out
2020/10/01, 21:18 - Adela: ahh you’re welcome
2020/10/01, 21:18 - Adela: thank YOU for explaining
2020/10/01, 21:19 - Adela: i shall do this... thank u ✨✨
2020/10/01, 21:19 - Jhyan: Of course
2020/10/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: Omg
2020/10/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: This question
2020/10/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: I went back and wrote it out
2020/10/01, 21:38 - Jhyan: It's secretly a binomial distribution question
2020/10/01, 21:39 - Jhyan: This is like when you rewatch a movie and see the foreshadowing intentionally placed
2020/10/01, 21:39 - Jhyan: 7b
2020/10/01, 21:44 - Adela: is that the next topic that he covers? i haven’t watched that video
2020/10/01, 21:44 - Adela: oh crap...
2020/10/01, 21:44 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/10/03, 01:54 - Jhyan: Have you ever watched anime movies
2020/10/03, 01:55 - Jhyan: Like anime is cool and all, but sometimes there are these masterpieces of film such as A Silent Voice or Your Name that come out of nowhere
2020/10/03, 01:55 - Jhyan: Every frame is a beautifully rendered artwork, and the stories make me cry
2020/10/03, 08:57 - Adela: i’ll definitely add these to my “must-watch” list... i’ve never actually gotten into anime, but i’ll try those films out
2020/10/03, 20:51 - Jhyan: There's also 5 Centimeters per Second
2020/10/04, 13:46 - Jhyan: Are you able to access Hardware Lesson 3
2020/10/04, 13:46 - Jhyan: On the IT GC
2020/10/04, 13:46 - Jhyan: It doesn't open for me
2020/10/04, 13:46 - Adela: i actually haven’t tried
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Adela: lemme check
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Adela: some of her slides only open if you use a laptop
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Jhyan: Maybe that's it
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Adela: i can’t open it on my phone
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Adela: you probably can open it on a laptop
2020/10/04, 13:47 - Jhyan: Ok thanks, I'm trying it on my laptop
2020/10/04, 13:48 - Adela: lemme know if it works
2020/10/04, 13:48 - Jhyan: Will do
2020/10/04, 13:49 - Jhyan: Damn doesn't work
2020/10/04, 13:50 - Jhyan: I think it's corrupted or something
2020/10/04, 13:51 - Jhyan: Yeah it is
2020/10/04, 13:51 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/04, 13:52 - Jhyan: Oh wait
2020/10/04, 13:52 - Jhyan: It reapiring it fixed it
2020/10/04, 13:52 - Jhyan: But I think you need PowerPoint to repair it
2020/10/04, 13:53 - Adela: i’ll try on my pc. i do have powerpoint so it should work
2020/10/04, 13:53 - Adela: i don’t really plan on studying IT today
2020/10/04, 13:53 - Jhyan: 👌🏻
2020/10/05, 15:10 - Jhyan: I bet you're happy with the rain
2020/10/05, 15:12 - Adela: i’m so happy... but i hope it continues to rain tonight because i love night rain
2020/10/05, 15:13 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/10/05, 15:13 - Jhyan: Me too
2020/10/05, 15:14 - Jhyan: You actually reminded me I need to bypass a gutter thing because it runs straight onto my roof and makes an annoying noise when I'm sleeping
2020/10/05, 15:15 - Adela: yeah you should do that otherwise it will annoy you at night yoh
2020/10/05, 18:54 - Jhyan: Did you do the trace table
2020/10/05, 18:58 - Adela: i’m actually in the process of doing it rn
2020/10/05, 18:59 - Jhyan: Mine is really long and complicated so I feel like I've made a mistake somewhere
2020/10/05, 19:02 - Jhyan: Was the tuck shop food good
2020/10/05, 19:24 - Adela: it was actually
2020/10/05, 19:25 - Adela: except for the part when it made me choke 😭
2020/10/05, 19:25 - Adela: thanks for asking x
2020/10/05, 19:25 - Adela: mine is short but the whole trace table is complicated to do tbh
2020/10/05, 19:26 - Jhyan: Damn mine is like 20 cells long
2020/10/05, 19:27 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/05, 19:27 - Jhyan: What even was it
2020/10/05, 19:27 - Jhyan: Spaghetti?
2020/10/05, 19:27 - Jhyan: Or do they have new stuff now
2020/10/05, 19:28 - Adela: yeah it was spaghetti bolognese
2020/10/05, 19:28 - Adela: mine is a lot shorter than that wtff
2020/10/05, 19:28 - Adela: i didn’t see any new stuff on the menu and the spaghetti is the only decent option for me personally
2020/10/05, 19:28 - Jhyan: I actually hate that spaghetti
2020/10/05, 19:29 - Jhyan: I'm gonna submit my table
2020/10/05, 19:54 - Adela: i submitted mine as it was
2020/10/05, 19:54 - Adela: how come
2020/10/05, 19:57 - Jhyan: Idk it's kinda greasy and I don't like the taste
2020/10/05, 19:57 - Jhyan: But mostly the grease
2020/10/05, 19:58 - Jhyan: But also my dad used to make Indianised spaghetti that was so delicious so maybe I'm just biased
2020/10/05, 19:59 - Jhyan: Althoughhough when I have proper Italian spaghetti in restaurants it's still ok so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020/10/05, 20:00 - Adela: italian spaghetti is amazing
2020/10/05, 20:00 - Adela: oh i feel you
2020/10/05, 20:00 - Adela: that sounds really good
2020/10/05, 20:02 - Jhyan: I have a memory of going to a place in Rosebank with my mom and eating it. I was surprised because it was way different. But yeah it is better than "ok" which is how I described it for some reason
2020/10/05, 20:02 - Jhyan: Yeah sometimes when I visit him he still makes it
2020/10/05, 21:24 - Jhyan: Some little kids probably sang rain rain go away 🌧️
2020/10/05, 21:26 - Adela: do you remember which place this was
2020/10/05, 21:26 - Adela: i’m so upset abt that because i would have loved to listen to the rain while i was sleeping
2020/10/05, 21:26 - Adela: that’s really cute
2020/10/05, 21:27 - Jhyan: Maybe my mom does but I don't
2020/10/05, 21:27 - Jhyan: I'll ask
2020/10/05, 21:49 - Jhyan: Good night for now though🌙
2020/10/05, 22:04 - Adela: goodnight jhyan ❤️
2020/10/06, 17:22 - Jhyan: We can do any day from Friday onwards. I know you don't study that early and exams are a month away so idk
2020/10/06, 17:26 - Adela: can we start from next week?
2020/10/06, 17:27 - Jhyan: Sure
2020/10/06, 17:27 - Jhyan: We'll get our story straight with physics
2020/10/06, 17:28 - Adela: i really need to revise this subject 🥴
2020/10/06, 17:29 - Jhyan: Yeah that's pretty much mutual
2020/10/06, 17:30 - Jhyan: We can also do other stuff if you want because we do the same subjects but I just thought since we were both complaining about physics that it would be best
2020/10/06, 18:06 - Adela: i think physics is the only thing that requires understanding. personally i don’t think business isn’t too bad and then it theory is memorisation more so than studying
2020/10/06, 18:13 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/06, 18:13 - Jhyan: I thought the same for theory subjects
2020/10/06, 18:14 - Adela: they’re not too bad
2020/10/06, 18:14 - Adela: physics is what i’m struggling with the most
2020/10/06, 18:14 - Adela: i don’t know about you
2020/10/06, 18:14 - Jhyan: No it's the same for me
2020/10/06, 18:15 - Jhyan: I was actually thinking maybe maths but that's not really a problem for me, it would just be more motivating to study with someone
2020/10/06, 18:16 - Jhyan: So we'll probably just do physics
2020/10/06, 18:16 - Jhyan: It's next week anyway
2020/10/06, 18:29 - Adela: yeah we can
2020/10/06, 18:29 - Adela: we can do that
2020/10/06, 18:29 - Adela: i don’t really study maths, i just do the revision exercises really
2020/10/06, 18:29 - Jhyan: Cool 🧊 we can always change plans
2020/10/06, 18:29 - Jhyan: That's called studying lmao
2020/10/06, 18:33 - Adela: but that’s how i do it
2020/10/06, 18:33 - Adela: so like idk how beneficial it would be to do it together
2020/10/06, 18:33 - Adela: ofc
2020/10/06, 18:33 - Jhyan: Yeah I do the same thing but also sometimes do the actual exercises if I want to reinforce the skill
2020/10/06, 18:34 - Jhyan: But I only started doing that at the end of last year
2020/10/06, 18:34 - Jhyan: I used to just look at the scope and check off the stuff that I knew and just look again at the textbook for the stuff I kinda forgot 😬
2020/10/06, 18:37 - Adela: yeah that’s what i used to always do
2020/10/06, 18:37 - Adela: yeah i do that for ap maths, especially the questions i struggled with
2020/10/06, 18:37 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/06, 18:38 - Adela: but we can always decide like later on
2020/10/06, 18:38 - Adela: because it’s only next week that we’ll start, right?
2020/10/06, 18:39 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/10/06, 18:40 - Jhyan: On discord me and Aidan just went over the stuff and confirmed facts we knew and method details and stuff which ensured that neither of us forgot something
2020/10/06, 18:41 - Jhyan: Unless both of us did but it's a game of probability at that point
2020/10/06, 19:04 - Adela: i doubt that will ever be the case tbh
2020/10/06, 19:04 - Adela: this is a really good method
2020/10/06, 19:05 - Jhyan: Yeah we can also compare notes since we will be in person
2020/10/07, 15:15 - Jhyan: Your shirt was cool today
2020/10/07, 15:15 - Jhyan: With the fluffy sleeve bands
2020/10/07, 15:21 - Adela: thank you so much 🥰
i actually got it when i was on holiday back in grade 8, i barely wear it honestly
2020/10/07, 22:06 - Jhyan: I made notes of everything important in the textbook
2020/10/07, 22:06 - Jhyan: For IT theory
2020/10/07, 22:08 - Adela: that must have taken so much time dude
2020/10/07, 22:08 - Jhyan: 8.5 pages because the textbook is full of useless extra information and repetition
2020/10/07, 22:09 - Jhyan: Yeah took me like probably 6 hours all together
2020/10/07, 22:11 - Jhyan: Are you ready for the test tomorrow
2020/10/07, 22:11 - Adela: i would hope i am
what about you?
2020/10/07, 22:31 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/10/07, 22:31 - Jhyan: Probably
2020/10/07, 22:32 - Jhyan: I hope my brain took in the information I was writing into notes
2020/10/07, 22:32 - Jhyan: I'll read over them tomorrow
2020/10/07, 22:49 - Adela: i’m hoping the same... IT theory just stresses me out because it’s just regurgitating information
2020/10/07, 22:49 - Jhyan: Yeah and you can't even explain it in your own words sometimes
2020/10/07, 22:49 - Jhyan: Even if you're right
2020/10/07, 22:50 - Jhyan: Like the textbook was saying web 3.0 is the next step
2020/10/07, 22:50 - Jhyan: But we're already in it as what it was defined as
2020/10/07, 22:51 - Jhyan: I'm pretty sure if she asks we'll get marked wrong if we say this though based on my experience with these tests
2020/10/07, 23:01 - Jhyan: Oh yeah also my mom said we can try to find that restaurant
2020/10/07, 23:01 - Adela: yeah that’s exactly what i was thinking
2020/10/07, 23:01 - Jhyan: So I'll tell you if I find it
2020/10/07, 23:01 - Adela: yeah there’s normally only one correct answer and it’s really stupid actually
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Adela: the one where you had the pasta?
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Adela: in rosebank?
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Adela: do you think they’re still there
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Jhyan: That's the one
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Adela: hopefully you do because you seemed to really enjoy the food
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Jhyan: Idk it was a long time ago
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Adela: maybe they’re still around... hopefully
2020/10/07, 23:02 - Jhyan: Maybe you can enjoy it too if it still exists
2020/10/07, 23:03 - Adela: where about in rosebank was it?
2020/10/07, 23:03 - Adela: like in the mall itself or like just the suburb
2020/10/07, 23:03 - Jhyan: I was like 8 or something
2020/10/07, 23:03 - Adela: oh wow... that’s a really long time ago
2020/10/07, 23:03 - Jhyan: So I wouldn't remember
2020/10/07, 23:04 - Adela: does your mom have a recollection of the place?
2020/10/07, 23:04 - Jhyan: Yeah but not the name
2020/10/07, 23:04 - Adela: surely she remembers where about it was
2020/10/07, 23:05 - Jhyan: I'll ask her then
2020/10/07, 23:06 - Adela: if you find it, please do let me know actually
would love to try it out
2020/10/07, 23:07 - Jhyan: She remembered the tablecloth patterns strangely enough
2020/10/07, 23:07 - Jhyan: Of course
2020/10/07, 23:07 - Adela: that’s such a strange thing to remember
2020/10/07, 23:08 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/07, 23:08 - Jhyan: Actually there's this really interesting effect I know about from this podcast that's also really cool about memory
2020/10/07, 23:09 - Jhyan: Actually it's too long to explain rn maybe I'll tell you another time
2020/10/07, 23:10 - Jhyan: The podcast is called Revisionist History
2020/10/07, 23:20 - Adela: please do when you have the time
2020/10/07, 23:22 - Jhyan: Idk you might've heard of Malcolm Gladwell but it's hosted by him and covers misunderstood or overlooked things from the past
2020/10/07, 23:22 - Jhyan: I'm not asking you to listen the podcast so don't feel pressured
2020/10/07, 23:23 - Jhyan: I'll keep it in mind
2020/10/07, 23:24 - Adela: i don’t think i have actually, doesn’t ring a bell
2020/10/07, 23:25 - Jhyan: He writes books
2020/10/07, 23:25 - Jhyan: They're always at the front of the book store with the ones by prominent authors
2020/10/07, 23:28 - Jhyan: I think they're all about human social dynamics but I'm not sure, I've only ever seen one of them in person and have yet to read it
2020/10/07, 23:31 - Adela: i haven’t read since august and i feel so bad abt it because i just really wanna read
2020/10/07, 23:32 - Jhyan: :(
2020/10/07, 23:32 - Jhyan: December holidays? After exams
2020/10/07, 23:32 - Jhyan: But that's in another 2 months...
2020/10/07, 23:33 - Adela: i’ll probably read during exams because i’ll have some time to myself
2020/10/07, 23:33 - Jhyan: That's what I would call living on the edge
2020/10/07, 23:36 - Jhyan: One of the episodes exposed To Kill a Mockingbird
2020/10/07, 23:38 - Jhyan: It's used as a staple in American education as a shining example of justice, but it actually had sinister motivations behind it
2020/10/07, 23:38 - Jhyan: It was about a black man that was wrongly accused of rape by a white woman who was found innocent
2020/10/07, 23:39 - Jhyan: But it was actually only due to the prejudice against women that that was possible
2020/10/07, 23:39 - Jhyan: They're not all negative but this one was memorable
2020/10/07, 23:40 - Jhyan: Like the man was found innocent in the end
2020/10/07, 23:40 - Adela: i always do it, somehow i end up dedicating so much time to free time during exams
2020/10/07, 23:40 - Adela: this was spoken abt in the podcast?
2020/10/07, 23:40 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/07, 23:40 - Adela: sounds like “when they see us”
2020/10/07, 23:41 - Jhyan: What's that
2020/10/07, 23:42 - Adela: it’s a netflix series which was also abt like this real situation where these black teenage boys were accused of the rape of a white girl
2020/10/07, 23:42 - Adela: and they went to jail and yeah
2020/10/07, 23:42 - Adela: they were really young
2020/10/07, 23:42 - Adela: but they were innocent
2020/10/07, 23:42 - Jhyan: Oh I see
2020/10/07, 23:43 - Jhyan: To Kill a Mockingbird was also about a real trial that actually happened, I suppose I should've mentioned that
2020/10/07, 23:44 - Jhyan: I kinda regret mentioning this now, it's kinda heavy
2020/10/07, 23:46 - Adela: ive never read that book, but have heard a lot abt it
2020/10/07, 23:47 - Jhyan: Yeah same
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Jhyan: Ok I'm probably gonna sleep
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Jhyan: Good luck with whatever you're doing
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Adela: hope that you sleep well
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Adela: i’m going to sleep now, didn’t manage to sleep properly last night
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Adela: i’ve been tired the whole day
2020/10/07, 23:48 - Jhyan: I hope you do too
2020/10/07, 23:49 - Jhyan: Yeah that moment when you were sleeping in IT
2020/10/07, 23:51 - Adela: i slept for the whole period lol
2020/10/07, 23:51 - Jhyan: Luckily we're doing it again tomorrow
2020/10/07, 23:51 - Jhyan: Uhhhh
2020/10/07, 23:52 - Jhyan: Next time
2020/10/07, 23:52 - Jhyan: Coz there's a test tomorrow
2020/10/09, 15:58 - Jhyan: What are you writing your descriptive essay on?
2020/10/09, 16:05 - Adela: i already wrote it, it’s basically abt me being in a restaurant and watching a family fight at the table adjacent to me
2020/10/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/10/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: I wrote mine too
2020/10/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: It's just that it's not exactly one incident
2020/10/09, 16:06 - Adela: what was your about
2020/10/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: It was recurring
2020/10/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: But they were all practically the same
2020/10/09, 16:07 - Jhyan: I used to sit next to the open freezer when I felt really sad
2020/10/09, 16:07 - Jhyan: It's about one of those moments
2020/10/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: I just don't know how to explain why it stands out to me
2020/10/09, 16:11 - Jhyan: Idk I don't really have that many memories that I either remember or that would work in these scenarios
2020/10/09, 16:11 - Jhyan: I guess I'll just see what they say in response
2020/10/09, 20:35 - Jhyan: Did you finish the valedictory
2020/10/09, 20:41 - Adela: yeah it’s still going on but i need to go home
2020/10/09, 20:42 - Jhyan: Wasn't it supposed to end at 7
2020/10/09, 20:57 - Adela: yes, yes it was
2020/10/09, 20:58 - Jhyan: So it ran late?
2020/10/09, 20:59 - Adela: as always
2020/10/09, 20:59 - Jhyan: How was it?
2020/10/09, 20:59 - Jhyan: Are you tired now?
2020/10/09, 21:07 - Adela: i’m exhausted
2020/10/09, 21:12 - Jhyan: Well at least it's Friday
2020/10/09, 21:12 - Jhyan: You can recuperate
2020/10/09, 21:13 - Adela: yeah then i need to work this weekend yoh
2020/10/09, 21:14 - Jhyan: Is there stuff due
2020/10/09, 21:14 - Jhyan: I'm perpetually scared I've missed an assignment
2020/10/09, 21:41 - Adela: i don’t think so
2020/10/09, 21:41 - Adela: final pat is due on wed
2020/10/09, 21:41 - Adela: that’s all
2020/10/09, 21:41 - Adela: and descriptive essay for today
2020/10/09, 21:41 - Jhyan: Oh I did forget about that
2020/10/09, 21:42 - Jhyan: I realised you were probably referring to work you had to catch up
2020/10/09, 21:42 - Adela: i also need to do that yoh
2020/10/09, 21:42 - Jhyan: I'm supposed to make the UI look modern because apparently it's easy
2020/10/09, 21:43 - Jhyan: So now I have to do that and rewrite all the documents
2020/10/09, 23:05 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙 hopefully you will feel energized ⚡ tomorrow
2020/10/09, 23:08 - Adela: i need to still make mine
2020/10/09, 23:08 - Adela: thanks jhyan, i really need sleep
2020/10/10, 19:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/10, 19:55 - Jhyan: It's actually really easy, you just have to edit the properties
2020/10/10, 19:55 - Jhyan: I'll tell you which ones to edit if you want
2020/10/10, 19:56 - Jhyan: Then you can design the colour scheme and remove the 3D-ness and shadows or whatever
2020/10/10, 19:56 - Jhyan: Like literally, it's exactly like changing the variable names
2020/10/10, 20:00 - Jhyan: I predict it will have a psychological impact so will earn marks indirectly
2020/10/10, 23:01 - Adela: please help me out
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Adela: that would be so useful
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Adela: oh i get what you’re saying
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Jhyan: Lemme get my laptop
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Jhyan: Are you busy doing it rn?
2020/10/10, 23:02 - Jhyan: Have you finished programming it?
2020/10/10, 23:03 - Jhyan: Because I think it's easier just to do it after it's done
2020/10/10, 23:03 - Adela: not the whole GUI part
2020/10/10, 23:04 - Jhyan: Ok tell me when your program is done because everything can be changed after that
2020/10/10, 23:05 - Jhyan: Ok that phrasing makes it sound like it requires doing everything again but it doesn't
2020/10/10, 23:07 - Jhyan: Or actually just as long as you've got all the GUI stuff together, you don't have to have the backend code
2020/10/10, 23:20 - Adela: okay i will, thank you so much
2020/10/10, 23:21 - Jhyan: I'm not entirely sure if it's necessary but put a JPanel behind all your UI elements
2020/10/10, 23:21 - Jhyan: Like just drag them onto it and drag out the edges so that it perfectly covers the JFrame
2020/10/10, 23:22 - Jhyan: But you can also do it later
2020/10/10, 23:57 - Adela: why should i?
2020/10/10, 23:57 - Jhyan: It lets you change the background colour
2020/10/10, 23:59 - Adela: oh i see.... i’ll do that then
2020/10/11, 18:13 - Jhyan: lmao I gave up after trying to put a button right next to a text field. I think some things are impossible
2020/10/11, 18:14 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/11, 18:14 - Jhyan: Oh yeah that heppened to me with the buttons only
2020/10/11, 18:14 - Adela: it’s happening to me with text fields and just everything
2020/10/11, 18:15 - Jhyan: I don't think I can help without seeing it, especially because my problem was caused by a specific border thing
2020/10/11, 18:16 - Adela: i’ll try put it on my laptop and show you tomorrow
2020/10/11, 18:16 - Adela: i’m just working off my PC right now
2020/10/11, 18:16 - Jhyan: Ok sure that will work
2020/10/11, 18:18 - Jhyan: Yeah there's like 500 different possible interpretations of that problem because of how many different problems can be described that way
2020/10/11, 18:27 - Jhyan: Is it really bad or just minor adjustments?
2020/10/11, 18:37 - Adela: it’s really bad
2020/10/11, 18:37 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/10/11, 18:40 - Jhyan: That's frustration 😬
2020/10/11, 18:47 - Adela: it’s so frustrating
2020/10/11, 19:22 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/11, 19:23 - Jhyan: very strange
2020/10/11, 19:23 - Jhyan: I've never had that problem
2020/10/11, 19:23 - Jhyan: But well done in figuring it out
2020/10/11, 19:36 - Jhyan: So most of the stuff can just have the background and foreground values changes in the properties
2020/10/11, 19:37 - Adela: yeah it took forever and it was really frustrating me
2020/10/11, 19:37 - Adela: because i want all the things to be the same sizes
2020/10/11, 19:37 - Jhyan: There's an rgb field, but you can also select colours manually with a colour picker if you click the small square with three dots to the right of it
2020/10/11, 19:38 - Jhyan: And you can turn off borders, change their type, or change their values
2020/10/11, 19:39 - Jhyan: And you have to expand the "look and feel" autogenerated code and replace the word Nimbus with anything else
2020/10/11, 20:10 - Adela: i’ll try this out, thank you so much
2020/10/11, 20:10 - Adela: nimbus?
2020/10/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: Um
2020/10/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: I'll send  a shirt video
2020/10/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: Like 5 seconds
2020/10/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: *shirt
2020/10/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: **short
2020/10/11, 21:12 - Jhyan: Oh I just remembered
2020/10/11, 21:12 - Jhyan: I haven't done that
2020/10/11, 21:20 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/11, 21:21 - Jhyan: So the thing I highlighted is what I rewrote instead
2020/10/11, 21:21 - Adela: thsnk you so much jhyan
2020/10/11, 21:21 - Jhyan: No problem
2020/10/11, 21:22 - Adela: i’ll try this out... i’m going to bring my laptop with the code tomorrow so if it’s possible, please can you help me out?
2020/10/11, 21:22 - Adela: also since it’s “next week” now, which days work for you for the physics studying?
2020/10/11, 21:22 - Jhyan: Literally any days work
2020/10/11, 21:22 - Jhyan: Yeah sure thing
2020/10/11, 21:23 - Adela: tuesday and thursday?
2020/10/11, 21:23 - Jhyan: Yeah ok cool
2020/10/11, 21:24 - Jhyan: See you tomorrow
2020/10/11, 21:25 - Adela: see you tomorrow, Jhyan
2020/10/12, 20:46 - Jhyan: So are we gonna study for like 1 hour or
2020/10/12, 20:46 - Adela: does 1 hour work for you?
2020/10/12, 20:46 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Adela: okay then sure, let’s do that.
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Adela: also do we have to do that whole class design for the GUI
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Adela: like where you list all the variables
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Jhyan: Wdym
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Jhyan: In phase 2?
2020/10/12, 20:47 - Adela: yeah in phase 2
2020/10/12, 20:48 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/12, 20:48 - Jhyan: Ohhh
2020/10/12, 20:48 - Jhyan: I misread the message
2020/10/12, 20:49 - Jhyan: I thought you were stating that we do have to, and was wondering why you would want to do that with me
2020/10/12, 20:49 - Jhyan: We do
2020/10/12, 20:49 - Jhyan: But she said we can leave out auto generated variables
2020/10/12, 20:50 - Adela: oh i get what you’re saying
2020/10/12, 20:50 - Adela: but there would be no methods in that case
2020/10/12, 20:50 - Jhyan: For the methods part of it I still added all the button press methods but I only added variables/fields that were  designed by me
2020/10/12, 20:51 - Adela: oh i see
2020/10/12, 20:51 - Jhyan: Every button has a method for when it's pressed
2020/10/12, 20:53 - Jhyan: Do you know if they're going to continue the school syllabus all the way until exams
2020/10/12, 20:54 - Jhyan: Because I want to have time to just study without worrying about book logistics and new information and having school taking all my energy before I get to spend it
2020/10/12, 20:57 - Adela: yeah we are, we don’t get time off until matric
2020/10/12, 20:59 - Jhyan: They did it in grade 9 or something
2020/10/12, 20:59 - Jhyan: They gave us a week off
2020/10/12, 20:59 - Jhyan: That's sad
2020/10/12, 21:34 - Adela: ok i finished phase 2 now with the GUI added into those table
2020/10/12, 21:34 - Adela: yeah eish
2020/10/12, 21:35 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/10/12, 21:36 - Jhyan: I'm just waiting for phase 3 back so I can redo that
2020/10/12, 21:36 - Adela: this IT PAT is particularly hard, but i think it’s just the template that she gave us
2020/10/12, 21:36 - Jhyan: Yeah the code isn't hard to me but this template is new
2020/10/12, 21:37 - Adela: the code isn’t too bad, it’s just the fact that my stuff kept resizing but i sorted that out
2020/10/12, 21:37 - Jhyan: It's like NetBeans was conspiring against you
2020/10/12, 21:37 - Adela: it really was dude yoh 💀
2020/10/12, 21:38 - Adela: but i’m glad i’m done with that now
2020/10/12, 21:39 - Jhyan: Yeah better then than tomorrow or Wednesday at 11:59 😬
2020/10/12, 21:40 - Adela: i just need to do phase 3 again then i’m done
2020/10/12, 21:40 - Adela: but phase 3 isn’t much
2020/10/12, 21:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/12, 21:41 - Jhyan: I might revise the other two documents to look for small adjustments
2020/10/12, 21:42 - Adela: i had to change my other two completely urgh 🥴
2020/10/12, 21:43 - Jhyan: What actually is your PAT
2020/10/12, 21:43 - Adela: it’s an ordering system for COVID-19 essentials
2020/10/12, 21:43 - Adela: what about yours?
2020/10/12, 21:44 - Jhyan: Wait I feel like I asked that before now
2020/10/12, 21:44 - Jhyan: It's a simple text editor with an extra feature of retrieving copypastas

2020/10/12, 21:45 - Adela: copypastas?
2020/10/12, 21:45 - Jhyan: This
2020/10/12, 21:45 - Adela: ohhh i’ve never heard of that before
2020/10/12, 21:45 - Jhyan: Well
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Adela: this is really cool though
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Jhyan: Copypastas are usually just paragraphs of actual text
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Jhyan: But that are easily memeable
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Jhyan: They just get copied and pasted in comments sections
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Jhyan: Lemme get a real one
2020/10/12, 21:46 - Jhyan: But I just did text art ones
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Jhyan: This one is actually pretty cool because it has a bunch of variants so if you send all of them and then scroll it becomes animated
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Adela: oh i see
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Adela: please do
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Adela: that’s so so cool
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Adela: it’s the fortnite dance
2020/10/12, 21:47 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/12, 21:49 - Jhyan: Ok this one is pretty famous
2020/10/12, 21:50 - Jhyan: omg the website doesn't let me copy it
2020/10/12, 21:50 - Jhyan: That's like the embodied villain of the idea of a copypasta
2020/10/12, 21:50 - Jhyan: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
2020/10/12, 21:51 - Jhyan: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta
2020/10/12, 21:52 - Jhyan: Anyway people use it sometimes just in response to anything in commentd
2020/10/12, 21:53 - Jhyan: There's also this one, playing on the overexaggerated comical nature of actions in old cartoons:
2020/10/12, 21:53 - Adela: i’m struggling to figure out what copypasta really means 💀
2020/10/12, 21:53 - Jhyan: *jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair* Ahem, you look very lovely.
2020/10/12, 21:55 - Jhyan: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=copypasta
2020/10/12, 21:56 - Jhyan: Ok that explains it very negatively but it's not always used to mock people, it's just amusing text most of the times I've seen it
2020/10/12, 21:56 - Adela: i’m starting to get it actually
2020/10/12, 21:56 - Jhyan: Sometimes you see a comment with an absurd unrelated story and it turns out it's a copypasta
2020/10/12, 21:57 - Jhyan: But anyway the ones in my PAT are just text art
2020/10/12, 21:58 - Jhyan: Which are also considered copypastas but they aren't the same
2020/10/12, 21:58 - Adela: i see
2020/10/12, 21:58 - Adela: oh i get you
2020/10/12, 21:59 - Jhyan: So you can edit a note file and you can also view your copypasta search history
2020/10/12, 22:00 - Adela: ohhh i see
2020/10/12, 22:00 - Adela: you must show me the code
2020/10/12, 22:00 - Jhyan: So does yours like calculate costs and stuff
2020/10/12, 22:00 - Jhyan: I will
2020/10/12, 22:05 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/10/12, 22:18 - Jhyan: Are you caught up with maths
2020/10/12, 22:19 - Jhyan: There's a test next week
2020/10/12, 22:50 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/10/12, 22:51 - Jhyan: Good night Adela 🌙
2020/10/12, 22:52 - Adela: goodnight jhyan 🕊
2020/10/12, 22:52 - Adela: i am actually. for ap maths i haven’t done today’s lesson
2020/10/13, 09:58 - Jhyan: How do you load money on your card
2020/10/13, 09:59 - Adela: you have to do it via EFT
2020/10/13, 10:01 - Jhyan: Just to the school account
2020/10/13, 10:01 - Jhyan: Do they just know it's for your card
2020/10/13, 10:02 - Adela: you have to like communicate what the money is for
my mom does it for me so i’m not too sure
2020/10/13, 10:18 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/10/13, 10:18 - Jhyan: Thanks
2020/10/13, 15:01 - Jhyan: Hey so school is over
2020/10/13, 15:03 - Jhyan: The physics classroom is open
2020/10/13, 15:04 - Adela: the old physics class?
2020/10/13, 15:05 - Jhyan: No
2020/10/13, 15:06 - Jhyan: Magodora
2020/10/13, 15:06 - Jhyan: Or
2020/10/13, 15:06 - Adela: we can do the studying there
2020/10/13, 15:06 - Adela: i’m seeing tanya off because she’s going home now
2020/10/13, 15:06 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/10/13, 15:10 - Adela: i’ll be there latest 15:15
2020/10/13, 16:16 - Jhyan: I think that was pretty productive
2020/10/13, 16:26 - Adela: i also think so, thanks again
2020/10/13, 16:26 - Jhyan: Thank you too
2020/10/13, 19:52 - Adela: jhyan, which section did we need to post a picture of our GUI to
2020/10/13, 19:52 - Jhyan: 2 of phase 2
2020/10/13, 19:53 - Jhyan: Presentation Layer
2020/10/13, 19:54 - Jhyan: There was something I was supposed to tell you but I forgot and it's been annoying me for hours
2020/10/13, 19:56 - Adela: thank you so much.
when you remember, do let me know
2020/10/13, 19:57 - Jhyan: It's ironic
2020/10/13, 19:57 - Jhyan: I thought of it and knew I would forget it
2020/10/13, 19:57 - Jhyan: So I created a new note for things I need to remember for later
2020/10/13, 19:57 - Jhyan: And then I got distracted by other stuff I wanted to remember
2020/10/13, 22:17 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI
2020/10/13, 22:17 - Jhyan: Idk if you'd find it interesting
2020/10/13, 22:17 - Jhyan: But I watched it yesterday
2020/10/13, 22:18 - Jhyan: For some reason it has the animation production quality of a professional 3D animation studio
2020/10/13, 22:19 - Jhyan: It's basically a 38 minute documentary about how life could possibly exist
2020/10/13, 22:20 - Jhyan: The subject matter is really interesting but even if you don't care at all about that it would still be worth it just to see the visual effects, there are absolutely stunning rendered alien worlds and stuff
2020/10/13, 22:53 - Adela: oh no 🥴
2020/10/13, 22:53 - Adela: i’ll give it a watch when i have the time, just been really busy recently
2020/10/13, 22:53 - Adela: no it looks really interesting. i’ll give it a watch at some point this week and i’ll let you know
2020/10/13, 22:54 - Jhyan: Great
2020/10/14, 16:41 - Jhyan: Don't forget to make a help document for the PAT
2020/10/14, 16:41 - Jhyan: I almost forgot
2020/10/14, 16:42 - Jhyan: You can make one in paint it's pretty easy
2020/10/14, 16:50 - Adela: i already did, but thanks so much jhyan
2020/10/14, 16:51 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/10/14, 16:51 - Jhyan: 🧊
2020/10/14, 16:57 - Adela: are we studying tomorrow?
2020/10/14, 16:57 - Jhyan: That was what we planned
2020/10/14, 16:57 - Adela: okay cool, was just double checking
2020/10/14, 16:58 - Jhyan: 🥂
2020/10/14, 19:40 - Jhyan: Hey
2020/10/14, 19:40 - Jhyan: Do you know if the sketches for integration are for marks
2020/10/14, 19:42 - Jhyan: He always says they're important to know if you'll have negative regions but I can do it without them or with very untidy ones
2020/10/14, 20:06 - Adela: i’m not sure whether there is an actual mark for it, i think there could be so it’s safer to just do it
2020/10/14, 20:08 - Jhyan: Well yeah the problem is that I don't actually think it's safer to do it unless it's absolutely necessary for marks
2020/10/14, 20:08 - Jhyan: Because it's AP
2020/10/14, 20:09 - Jhyan: Literally seconds matter
2020/10/14, 20:09 - Adela: i think judge off of the mark allocation
2020/10/14, 20:09 - Jhyan: Lmao but it'll be for like 15 marks how am I supposed to tell
2020/10/14, 20:09 - Adela: if it’s 15 then i suppose the sketch counts
2020/10/14, 20:11 - Jhyan: Ok thanks
2020/10/14, 20:18 - Jhyan: I'll ask him tomorrow
2020/10/14, 20:18 - Jhyan: Just in case
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Jhyan: Do you think regular counting principles are in the test tomorrow
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Jhyan: Because they're not in the pages he listed for the scope
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Jhyan: And we only did them in term 1
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Adela: i don’t think so, but maybe...
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Adela: i doubt in that case
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Adela: i think the test is just integration and then the random variables
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Adela: well i hope so
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/14, 22:42 - Jhyan: That's what he said
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Jhyan: And the normal distribution isn't in it
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Jhyan: I asked him
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Adela: yeah i think it’s too new
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Jhyan: But you never know with him
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Jhyan: I reviewed them just in case
2020/10/14, 22:43 - Adela: the normal distribution is really easy though urgh
2020/10/14, 22:44 - Jhyan: Yeah could've been some easy maths
2020/10/14, 22:44 - Jhyan: *marks
2020/10/14, 22:44 - Jhyan: But apparently it's more difficult if there's a different mean or standard deviation or whatever
2020/10/14, 22:44 - Jhyan: The stuff in the more recent videos
2020/10/14, 22:45 - Adela: i was working with those and it still doesn’t seem too difficult
2020/10/14, 22:45 - Jhyan: Oh ok that's good
2020/10/14, 22:45 - Jhyan: I haven't done any videos from this week yet
2020/10/14, 23:26 - Adela: i haven’t done the trig videos and i really need to do that 🥴
2020/10/14, 23:26 - Jhyan: For AP
2020/10/14, 23:26 - Jhyan: ?
2020/10/14, 23:26 - Adela: yeah for AP
2020/10/14, 23:26 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/10/14, 23:27 - Jhyan: I thought you meant core for a second
2020/10/14, 23:27 - Jhyan: And there's a whole test on almost only that on Tuesday
2020/10/14, 23:28 - Adela: no i definitely did core 💀
2020/10/14, 23:29 - Jhyan: I forgot how nice it is at night
2020/10/14, 23:29 - Jhyan: I can do things uninterrupted
2020/10/14, 23:30 - Jhyan: Would've been like
2020/10/14, 23:30 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/14, 23:50 - Jhyan: Good night🌙
2020/10/14, 23:50 - Jhyan: Good luck for the test
2020/10/14, 23:51 - Adela: it would have really been the end for me 💀
2020/10/14, 23:51 - Adela: goodnight jhyan ✨
2020/10/14, 23:51 - Adela: good luck to you too
2020/10/14, 23:51 - Adela: nighttime is the best time
2020/10/15, 15:02 - Jhyan: I'm in the physics class again
2020/10/15, 15:23 - Adela: on my way
2020/10/16, 18:05 - Jhyan: What's your school email address
2020/10/16, 18:05 - Adela: jardia21@ischool.org.za
2020/10/16, 18:06 - Jhyan: Thanks
2020/10/16, 18:06 - Jhyan: Ok you're now an editor of the form
2020/10/16, 18:07 - Jhyan: You can change it if you want or just look at the data
2020/10/16, 18:08 - Jhyan: Well you have to accept it in your email I think
2020/10/16, 18:18 - Jhyan: Some of the elements don't visually apply in just a design sketch such as the "ages well", but they can both be ignored and will still be useful later on
2020/10/17, 20:22 - Jhyan: Did you watch this
2020/10/18, 08:39 - Adela: thanks jhyan
2020/10/18, 08:40 - Adela: i really haven’t had the time yet... i was a party last night
2020/10/18, 08:40 - Jhyan: 👌🏻
2020/10/18, 08:46 - Jhyan: Oh I found this cool app for sleep but idk if it works yet because I only used it today but I woke up before it went off
2020/10/18, 08:49 - Jhyan: It's an alarm based on sleep cycles that is supposed to wake you up when you're finished a cycle so that it doesn't interrupt it. So your brain supposedly goes into a cycle and then turns back "on" again and repeats, and the alarm wakes you up before you enter the next one
2020/10/18, 08:49 - Jhyan: It's called Sleep Cycle
2020/10/18, 08:53 - Jhyan: I just thought it might be useful to you because you struggle with sleep
2020/10/18, 09:33 - Adela: thank you so much
2020/10/18, 09:33 - Adela: i’ll download it right now and give it a try
2020/10/18, 11:32 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/18, 11:32 - Jhyan: I got up and waited for it so I could hit it with the electric fly swatter but it took a few attempts
2020/10/18, 18:12 - Adela: 100% quality? yoh!
2020/10/18, 18:12 - Adela: how does it monitor those things?
2020/10/18, 18:15 - Jhyan: It uses your microphone to track breathing patterns
2020/10/18, 18:16 - Jhyan: I read their data privacy policy and it checks out though
2020/10/18, 18:16 - Adela: so you have to sleep with your phone close to your head then?
2020/10/18, 18:16 - Jhyan: I'm not too sure but it will probably just scale up the audio so as long as you don't have a lot of noise at night it should be fine
2020/10/18, 18:17 - Jhyan: Like idk what the range is but even if it's very soft it would be reasonable to multiply the volume for analysis or even just compare it as is since there isn't any distortion
2020/10/18, 18:17 - Jhyan: That's what I would do if I designed the system
2020/10/18, 18:20 - Jhyan: There's also a lot of crazy maths computation stuff that could be done to extract useful information that wouldn't be as easy but would also be possible. I don't really know how they do it exactly
2020/10/18, 18:22 - Adela: i’ll try leave my phone the usual distance from me tonight and see if it picks me up
2020/10/18, 18:22 - Jhyan: Yeah should work
2020/10/19, 14:17 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 15:06 - Jhyan: Were you awake
2020/10/19, 15:06 - Jhyan: At 5:30 and 7
2020/10/19, 15:07 - Jhyan: Yours is way smoother
2020/10/19, 15:32 - Adela: not that i know of
2020/10/19, 15:36 - Jhyan: Imagine you sleep like a whole night
2020/10/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: Like not just 4 hours or whatever
2020/10/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: And then you look at the graph
2020/10/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: And there's a huge chunk that it says you were aware
2020/10/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: *awake
2020/10/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: But you don't remember anything
2020/10/19, 15:38 - Jhyan: Maybe you were just breathing in a way that was really close to a lucid person, but what matters is that it woke you up between cycles so that's good
2020/10/19, 15:39 - Jhyan: That would be pretty scary, if you had used it previously and it never gave you that before
2020/10/19, 15:40 - Jhyan: One time the bearded dragon I used to have escaped and my mom said she had to wake me up to chase it around the house but I didn't remember that at all
2020/10/19, 16:12 - Adela: that would be quite scary 🥴
2020/10/19, 16:12 - Adela: i think that could be the case, i don’t recall being awake
2020/10/19, 16:12 - Adela: but you did go and chase it around the house? that’s so weird
2020/10/19, 16:13 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/19, 16:13 - Jhyan: It was running around the kitchen or something
2020/10/19, 16:13 - Jhyan: It's not the only time it's happened, but it's the only time that was significant
2020/10/19, 16:13 - Jhyan: Maybe you got up for a glass of water or something and forgot
2020/10/19, 16:16 - Adela: oh i see
2020/10/19, 16:16 - Adela: i dont think i got out of bed last night
2020/10/19, 19:37 - Jhyan: Do you know what converse angles in the same segment is for
2020/10/19, 19:38 - Jhyan: It's in your notes that you sent me but I don't think I've ever used it and I can't figure out what it would be used to prove
2020/10/19, 19:38 - Jhyan: Like that the lines are chords or straight maybe
2020/10/19, 19:39 - Jhyan: If you ask why I'm looking at Euclidean geometry it's because I saw like 2 questions using it in one of the chapters he said to study
2020/10/19, 19:42 - Adela: i actually dont know
2020/10/19, 19:42 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/10/19, 19:43 - Jhyan: Well it's probably fine
2020/10/19, 20:12 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 20:13 - Jhyan: I think so
2020/10/19, 20:14 - Jhyan: B and A = 50
B' and A' = x
etc.
2020/10/19, 20:14 - Adela: but how would you go about finding out what x is equal to
2020/10/19, 20:15 - Jhyan: Well they're independent
2020/10/19, 20:15 - Jhyan: So P(A) × P(B) = P(A and B)
2020/10/19, 20:16 - Jhyan: Wait but then
2020/10/19, 20:16 - Jhyan: Idk if the table is of probabilities or amounts in a whole
2020/10/19, 20:16 - Jhyan: It's a very confusing table
2020/10/19, 20:16 - Jhyan: I doubt they'd give us something that confusing
2020/10/19, 20:17 - Jhyan: Oh wait I'm stupid
2020/10/19, 20:17 - Jhyan: Draw a Venn diagram
2020/10/19, 20:18 - Adela: okay lemme try it out
2020/10/19, 20:28 - Jhyan: Did you get it
2020/10/19, 20:28 - Jhyan: I can't figure it out
2020/10/19, 20:38 - Adela: i did figure it out
2020/10/19, 20:39 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 20:40 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/10/19, 20:40 - Adela: the first line was a continuation from the first page where i was just indicating that they’re independent
2020/10/19, 20:40 - Jhyan: Is that the right answer
2020/10/19, 20:40 - Adela: so this rule
2020/10/19, 20:41 - Jhyan: Like in the textbook
2020/10/19, 20:41 - Adela: yes
2020/10/19, 20:42 - Jhyan: I would've done that but I thought you can't just add the intersection to each one because it contains outcomes from both events
2020/10/19, 20:42 - Adela: it took a lot of figuring out on my part
2020/10/19, 20:42 - Jhyan: So I thought P(A) ≠ P(only A) +P(A and B)
2020/10/19, 20:43 - Adela: judging off the table, it’s not an assumption but it’s given
2020/10/19, 20:43 - Jhyan: How is it given
2020/10/19, 20:44 - Adela: this table
2020/10/19, 20:44 - Adela: like they say 75 is purely B and not A
and then 60 is purely A and not B
2020/10/19, 20:45 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 20:45 - Jhyan: This doesn't seem right because what if the intersection contained like 25 from each
2020/10/19, 20:46 - Jhyan: Then A would be 85 and B would be 100
2020/10/19, 20:46 - Adela: the intersection can’t contain 25 from each because then it wouldn’t be an intersection
2020/10/19, 20:47 - Jhyan: This is hurting my brain I must've forgotten everything from term 2
2020/10/19, 20:47 - Jhyan: *1
2020/10/19, 20:47 - Adela: thats why i focused on probability a bit because the random variables starting getting to my head.
and triangles we’ve done a lot of working on
2020/10/19, 20:48 - Jhyan: Random variables are super easy for me though
2020/10/19, 20:48 - Adela: for me too, but i’m scared i’ll use those concepts in core
2020/10/19, 20:48 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/10/19, 20:56 - Jhyan: I'm lucky you decided to ask me
2020/10/19, 20:56 - Jhyan: I probably wouldn't have gone over probability more in depth
2020/10/19, 21:05 - Adela: ahh then you’re welcome
2020/10/19, 21:06 - Jhyan: Does h have 4 events
2020/10/19, 21:10 - Adela: i didn’t do H 🥴
2020/10/19, 21:10 - Jhyan: Lemme try it with 4 events
2020/10/19, 21:10 - Jhyan: I think there's something simple you're supposed to do
2020/10/19, 21:34 - Jhyan: I can do all of them except h
2020/10/19, 22:02 - Adela: oh wait
2020/10/19, 22:02 - Adela: i can do H
2020/10/19, 22:02 - Adela: i can’t do I
2020/10/19, 22:03 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 22:03 - Jhyan: I did i in my head so I can't send a picture
2020/10/19, 22:04 - Jhyan: Basically since they're exhaustive sum of their probabilities equals 1
2020/10/19, 22:04 - Adela: but then how can A = S when that would imply that A is the entire sample space
2020/10/19, 22:04 - Jhyan: Wait I'm trying to remember how I did it
2020/10/19, 22:05 - Jhyan: P(A)+P(B) = 1
2020/10/19, 22:06 - Jhyan: P(A)×P(B) = P(A and B)
2020/10/19, 22:07 - Jhyan: P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A and B)
2020/10/19, 22:07 - Adela: no P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 1
2020/10/19, 22:07 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/10/19, 22:07 - Adela: i don’t know how to do it beyond that
2020/10/19, 22:08 - Jhyan: I literally did this minutes ago and now my brain is going blank
2020/10/19, 22:08 - Adela: no problem
2020/10/19, 22:08 - Jhyan: P(A) + P(B) - P(A) ×P(B) = 1
2020/10/19, 22:09 - Adela: yes
2020/10/19, 22:13 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/10/19, 22:14 - Jhyan: P(A or B) = 1
2020/10/19, 22:17 - Jhyan: Ok lemme get paper
2020/10/19, 22:20 - Adela: alright
2020/10/19, 22:52 - Jhyan: I understand why it's true in my head now but I don't know how to prove it
2020/10/19, 22:52 - Jhyan: I should've written it down the first time
2020/10/19, 23:02 - Jhyan: I don't think it's the way I did it before but I think I figured it out
2020/10/19, 23:02 - Jhyan: And idk if it would work in a test because he technically didn't teach it to us
2020/10/19, 23:02 - Jhyan: Is conditional probability AP because if it is it also doesn't work
2020/10/19, 23:12 - Jhyan: Ok I either forgot a part of it or I was wrong
2020/10/19, 23:12 - Jhyan: I'm too tired to do this
2020/10/19, 23:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/19, 23:38 - Adela: thank you jhyan
2020/10/19, 23:38 - Adela: i don’t know where conditional probability falls under
2020/10/19, 23:39 - Jhyan: I did it a simple way earlier
2020/10/19, 23:39 - Jhyan: I just don't remember
2020/10/19, 23:39 - Jhyan: And my brain isn't thinking of it for some reason
2020/10/19, 23:39 - Jhyan: But anyway
2020/10/19, 23:39 - Jhyan: That's why I'm gonna sleep
2020/10/19, 23:40 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙 :)
2020/10/19, 23:42 - Adela: maybe it will come to you later
2020/10/19, 23:42 - Adela: goodnight
2020/10/19, 23:42 - Adela: wait are we studying tomorrow?
2020/10/19, 23:42 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/19, 23:42 - Adela: okay cool
2020/10/20, 15:04 - Jhyan: They started cleaning the classroom again so I'm just waiting outside
2020/10/20, 15:04 - Adela: alright, i’ll be there soon
2020/10/20, 15:04 - Jhyan: 🧊
2020/10/20, 16:57 - Jhyan: What movies did she make you hate
2020/10/20, 16:58 - Jhyan: You said English made you hate movies you used to like
2020/10/20, 19:32 - Adela: basically just romeo and juliet honestly
2020/10/20, 19:37 - Jhyan: Didn't we do it in grade 8
2020/10/20, 19:37 - Jhyan: I switched classes at just the right time so I did something else instead
2020/10/20, 19:37 - Jhyan: Was it ruined back then already
2020/10/20, 19:38 - Jhyan: Also where will the pride flag go
2020/10/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: Because it's kinda a waste if it just goes into storage or something and only gets put up in special events
2020/10/20, 19:51 - Adela: we did, yes
2020/10/20, 19:51 - Adela: no i actually enjoyed it
2020/10/20, 19:51 - Adela: no i think it will be permanently hanging in the school
2020/10/20, 19:51 - Jhyan: Oh that's good then
2020/10/20, 20:59 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/20, 20:59 - Jhyan: So you didn't lose marks there
2020/10/20, 20:59 - Jhyan: WhatsApp cuts off the image you have to click it
2020/10/20, 20:59 - Adela: oh thank god 🥺🥺🥺
2020/10/20, 21:00 - Jhyan: Reading through this memo I'm pretty sure I got more marks for this than the test today 🙃
2020/10/20, 21:00 - Adela: the test today was horrible :/
2020/10/20, 21:00 - Jhyan: Everybody said it was ok
2020/10/20, 21:00 - Jhyan: But I'm glad at least we're in the same boat
2020/10/20, 21:01 - Jhyan: I was about to say this again but I already told you
2020/10/20, 21:16 - Adela: did you take my calculator accidentally today?
2020/10/20, 21:16 - Adela: everyone i’ve spoken to seems to have struggled
2020/10/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: No
2020/10/20, 21:16 - Jhyan: Not that I'm aware of
2020/10/20, 21:17 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/20, 21:17 - Adela: pleas can you check?
2020/10/20, 21:18 - Adela: oh crap that means i left it in the class 🥴🥴
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: I wish I did now because that thing is expensive
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: Lucky we're in zones because last year someone stole mine from my bag
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Adela: wait wait
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Adela: i found it
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Adela: i was panicking
2020/10/20, 21:19 - Jhyan: Oh that's good :)
2020/10/20, 21:30 - Adela: i don’t think i’ll be able to make it to study physics on thursday, just thought i should tell you in advance.
i have this fitting for this dress i’m wearing for this md next week
2020/10/20, 21:31 - Jhyan: Oh ok thanks for letting my know
2020/10/20, 21:31 - Jhyan: *me
2020/10/21, 00:01 - Jhyan: Idk about you but it's drizzling for me 🌧️
2020/10/21, 00:01 - Adela: me too, i’m so happy 🥺🥺🥺
2020/10/21, 00:02 - Jhyan: I knew you'd be happy
2020/10/21, 00:09 - Adela: i really am
2020/10/21, 00:09 - Adela: i love the sound
2020/10/21, 00:11 - Jhyan: ☺️
2020/10/21, 16:56 - Jhyan: Did you get the descriptive essay back
2020/10/21, 16:57 - Adela: yeah i did
2020/10/21, 16:57 - Adela: and you?
2020/10/21, 16:57 - Jhyan: Mrs Van Zyl said I had to write it on paper so she could properly annotate it
2020/10/21, 16:58 - Jhyan: Are you proud of it
2020/10/21, 16:59 - Jhyan: Or were you
2020/10/21, 17:00 - Jhyan: I was really satisfied after I wrote mine
2020/10/21, 17:02 - Adela: yeah i am
2020/10/21, 21:20 - Jhyan: What do you think about the workload rn
2020/10/21, 21:20 - Jhyan: For school
2020/10/21, 21:23 - Adela: it’s way too much
2020/10/21, 21:23 - Adela: i’m so overwhelmed
2020/10/21, 21:23 - Jhyan: Thank God
2020/10/21, 21:23 - Jhyan: Not that you're overwhelmed
2020/10/21, 21:24 - Jhyan: But I thought I was the only one
2020/10/21, 21:24 - Jhyan: Like we're still writing tests and have like 10 assignments
2020/10/21, 21:25 - Jhyan: I asked when we'll have time to study and they straight up said no
2020/10/21, 21:25 - Jhyan: We get 1 study day
2020/10/21, 21:26 - Adela: no i’m definitely there too
2020/10/21, 21:26 - Jhyan: So now I have to restructure the way I study for exams that I've been developing for 2 years into something I've never done before
2020/10/21, 21:26 - Adela: yeah and we’re so close to exams
2020/10/21, 21:26 - Adela: which is?
2020/10/21, 21:27 - Jhyan: I literally just do long chunks of studying maths by doing like every example in the textbook
2020/10/21, 21:28 - Jhyan: It's not like I invented it
2020/10/21, 21:29 - Jhyan: The point is the fact that I just do hours at a time and now I have to cut it into small daily amounts because we have school all the way until exams start
2020/10/21, 21:30 - Jhyan: Not just maths but it's the most prominent there, I didn't change much for other subjects
2020/10/21, 21:30 - Jhyan: You said you just do the chapter summaries so maybe I'll just do that and see how it goes
2020/10/21, 21:50 - Adela: i normally just do the day before 💀
2020/10/21, 21:50 - Adela: yeah that is what i do
2020/10/21, 21:50 - Adela: i cram
2020/10/21, 21:51 - Jhyan: I'm scared of cramming
2020/10/21, 21:51 - Adela: how come
2020/10/21, 21:51 - Jhyan: Coz like what if I forget something
2020/10/21, 21:52 - Jhyan: It seems way more likely if I sped through all the work
2020/10/21, 21:52 - Jhyan: And what if some last minute thing happens and you can't cram
2020/10/21, 21:53 - Jhyan: Idk when I do lots of examples and try to reverse engineer how it works I understand it
2020/10/21, 21:54 - Adela: i leave it up to chance 🤷🏽‍♀️
2020/10/21, 21:54 - Jhyan: And it minimises the chance that I'll come across an exception that requires a tiny amount of knowledge
2020/10/21, 21:54 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/21, 21:55 - Adela: i see
2020/10/21, 21:55 - Adela: i get how you study
2020/10/21, 21:55 - Adela: but it just requires time
2020/10/21, 21:55 - Jhyan: Yeah exactly and now we don't have any 😬
2020/10/21, 21:55 - Adela: exactly
2020/10/21, 21:56 - Jhyan: Another thing is that I forgot how to cram
2020/10/21, 21:56 - Jhyan: I used to do it sometimes for non exams
2020/10/21, 21:56 - Jhyan: And also how to loosely study like I used to
2020/10/21, 21:56 - Adela: i do it all the time 💀
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Jhyan: So I don't know if I'd be able to pull out off
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Jhyan: Maybe my brain lost the ability to cram because I stopped doing it but I wouldn't know that until in the exam
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Adela: don’t do it if you’re not comfortable with the method
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Adela: i just have a good memory
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Jhyan: This is 1 sentence horror story
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Adela: so i abuse it 💀
2020/10/21, 21:57 - Jhyan: Yeah no I'm just explaining why it scares me
2020/10/21, 21:59 - Jhyan: I think my dad likes to scare me by exaggerating university exams.
2020/10/21, 22:00 - Jhyan: He was telling me about how engineering exams had like so many formulas that they wouldn't fit on the 2 sides of the a4 pages you are allowed to bring in no matter how small you write.
2020/10/21, 22:01 - Jhyan: And like maths people would be given a super huge equation that takes a year to solve
2020/10/21, 22:02 - Jhyan: And you have to learn everything in the entire textbook because they don't say what they're testing on
2020/10/21, 22:02 - Adela: that sounds really terrifying
2020/10/21, 22:02 - Adela: this sounds like an exaggeration
2020/10/21, 22:02 - Adela: this sounds probable
2020/10/21, 22:03 - Jhyan: I'm trying to remember this other thing he said
2020/10/21, 22:08 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/21, 22:08 - Jhyan: This isn't it but I was reminded of it
2020/10/21, 22:09 - Jhyan: It's a problem from a maths competition that has a median score of 2/120 marks for undergraduates
2020/10/21, 22:09 - Adela: this looks absolutely terrible
2020/10/21, 22:09 - Adela: that sounds really bad 💀💀💀
2020/10/21, 22:09 - Jhyan: It's inconceivable to us
2020/10/21, 22:10 - Jhyan: Like a random 3d shape that's not prismic
2020/10/21, 22:10 - Adela: that question is hurting my brain
2020/10/21, 22:10 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/OkmNXy7er84
2020/10/21, 22:11 - Jhyan: If you want to watch it
2020/10/21, 22:11 - Jhyan: I'm just watching it again
2020/10/21, 22:19 - Jhyan: Oh it's actually easy
2020/10/21, 23:07 - Jhyan: Good night Adela 🌙
2020/10/21, 23:20 - Adela: good night jhyan ✨
2020/10/22, 11:38 - Jhyan: We have 10 assessments next week, 4 of them being cycle tests
2020/10/22, 15:02 - Jhyan: Have fun with your dress fitting
2020/10/22, 15:03 - Adela: thank you jhyan
2020/10/23, 10:32 - Jhyan: What were we going to ask sir about
2020/10/23, 10:32 - Jhyan: From Tuesday
2020/10/23, 11:55 - Jhyan: Is today the last day for the raffle
2020/10/23, 11:55 - Adela: no it isn’t
2020/10/23, 11:56 - Jhyan: I keep forgetting to bring R15
2020/10/23, 12:03 - Adela: don’t worry abt it, the raffle is going on until exams
2020/10/24, 13:14 - Jhyan: Are you wearing a mask in your own house
2020/10/24, 13:15 - Adela: no i never do that. why?
2020/10/24, 13:15 - Jhyan: Because it looks like that
2020/10/24, 13:15 - Jhyan: Oh it's the school
2020/10/24, 13:15 - Adela: no no, that was taken at school
2020/10/24, 13:16 - Jhyan: The ceiling is similar to yours
2020/10/24, 13:16 - Adela: yes, that’s true 😂
it’s taken in physics
2020/10/24, 17:56 - Jhyan: Remember question i
2020/10/24, 17:57 - Jhyan: From the probability chapter summary exercise
2020/10/24, 18:14 - Adela: yes i do
2020/10/24, 18:15 - Jhyan: If you find out how to do it please tell me
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Adela: you still haven’t figured out?
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Jhyan: I think when I did it in my head I might've made a mistake that allowed me to do it, I'm starting to doubt that I solved it myself
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Jhyan: Well it's not like I've been looking at it every day since we saw it
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Adela: i’ll just ask sir when we see him again
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Jhyan: I just looked at it again briefly and didn't want to waste more time on it
2020/10/24, 18:16 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/10/24, 18:21 - Adela: not that you would 😂
2020/10/24, 18:22 - Adela: yeah you shouldn’t do that
2020/10/24, 18:22 - Jhyan: There's also this question at the end of chapter 2 that's SOOOO annoying
2020/10/24, 18:22 - Jhyan: It's basically a physics wisdom but you can't use kinematic equations
2020/10/24, 18:23 - Jhyan: Idek if those would help
2020/10/24, 18:23 - Jhyan: It's about a train
2020/10/24, 19:14 - Jhyan: Google's weather widget says 0% chance of precipitation lmao
2020/10/24, 19:17 - Adela: it’s raining here
2020/10/24, 19:17 - Adela: i didn’t see that one
2020/10/24, 19:17 - Adela: you can show me the question if you’d like
2020/10/24, 19:17 - Jhyan: Yeah exactly
2020/10/24, 19:19 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/24, 19:19 - Jhyan: You don't have to do it I was just complaining out loud
2020/10/24, 19:19 - Jhyan: Coz i reminded me of it
2020/10/24, 19:22 - Adela: i did it in term 1
2020/10/24, 19:22 - Adela: i remember this
2020/10/24, 19:23 - Jhyan: Yeah I also did it but I forgot it
2020/10/24, 19:28 - Adela: actually wait. i could never do it
2020/10/24, 19:28 - Adela: i tried and failed
2020/10/24, 22:11 - Jhyan: I had to draw a diagram and everything
2020/10/24, 22:20 - Adela: did you figure it out
2020/10/24, 22:20 - Jhyan: No I'm just saying that's how I did it before
2020/10/24, 22:20 - Adela: oh i see
2020/10/24, 22:20 - Jhyan: Do you want me to try
2020/10/24, 22:25 - Adela: no i’m fine, but if you would like to then i say that you should give it a go
2020/10/24, 22:29 - Jhyan: Oh I did it
2020/10/24, 22:29 - Jhyan: But only because I checked the answer earlier so I knew when I was wrong
2020/10/24, 22:41 - Adela: did it work?
2020/10/24, 22:41 - Jhyan: Yeah but I checked the answer earlier
2020/10/25, 17:10 - Adela: i remember you were asking abt a definition of ion
2020/10/25, 17:10 - Adela: i found one in my physics book that he gave us
2020/10/25, 17:10 - Adela: ion: any species that has an unequal number of protons and electrons
2020/10/25, 17:11 - Jhyan: Oh thanks
2020/10/25, 17:11 - Jhyan: Thank you for remembering
2020/10/25, 21:22 - Adela: would it be okay with you if we just study on thursday? i’m just really stressed out right now and think it would be beneficial if i’m just home early from monday to wednesday so i can complete assignments and stuff
2020/10/25, 21:26 - Jhyan: Of course
2020/10/25, 21:28 - Jhyan: I'm at a much better place with physics then I was a few weeks ago so it's actually no problem
2020/10/25, 21:34 - Adela: i also feel like i am, well i hope so
2020/10/25, 21:34 - Jhyan: I'm glad
2020/10/26, 17:01 - Jhyan: Do you maybe wanna go over some maths on Thursday
2020/10/26, 17:01 - Jhyan: Like just explain our understandings of some concepts
2020/10/26, 17:01 - Jhyan: Idk maybe it wouldn't be that useful to you
2020/10/26, 17:04 - Jhyan: But it would be helpful for me to just communicate it. I understand things but just psychologically them would solidify it and put my mind at ease
2020/10/26, 17:05 - Jhyan: And you approved of it before
2020/10/26, 20:35 - Adela: unfortunately, i don’t know if i can come on thursday because i have to go and buy some stuff for the md on friday 🥴
2020/10/26, 20:36 - Jhyan: How does buying stuff on Friday interfere with Thursday
2020/10/26, 20:38 - Adela: no the md is on friday but i have to buy stuff on thursday
2020/10/26, 20:38 - Adela: like jewellery
2020/10/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/10/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: I see now
2020/10/26, 20:41 - Jhyan: Well that's annoying
2020/10/26, 20:41 - Adela: the md in general is quite annoying 💀
2020/10/26, 20:42 - Adela: i’m so sorry 🥴
2020/10/26, 20:42 - Jhyan: Nah don't worry about it
2020/10/27, 12:16 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/27, 12:17 - Jhyan: For physics
2020/10/27, 12:21 - Adela: i cannot see a thing 😭😭😭
2020/10/27, 18:12 - Jhyan: You're an editor again so you can make changes if you want
2020/10/27, 18:12 - Adela: thanks so much jhyan 🥺
2020/10/27, 18:13 - Jhyan: No problem
2020/10/27, 18:13 - Adela: what was this actually? 😂
2020/10/27, 18:13 - Jhyan: I made it in paint to mock the one in the practice iebt 😂
2020/10/27, 18:13 - Jhyan: 600 million volts
2020/10/27, 18:13 - Adela: oh i get it now 😂😂😂
2020/10/27, 18:14 - Adela: the test we wrote on monday was so bad
2020/10/27, 18:14 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/27, 18:14 - Jhyan: Well I was fine with it but everyone seemed to struggle
2020/10/27, 18:14 - Jhyan: I hope exams are better
2020/10/27, 18:33 - Jhyan: Did you find out if the business report is on marketing
2020/10/27, 18:33 - Jhyan: The group didn't respond
2020/10/27, 18:41 - Adela: tapiwa responded saying that it is
2020/10/27, 18:41 - Jhyan: Really
2020/10/27, 18:42 - Jhyan: I must've opened it and forgot or something
2020/10/28, 16:50 - Jhyan: How was that report
2020/10/28, 16:50 - Adela: i generally don’t like doing reports... i feel like i put insufficient information 🥴
2020/10/28, 16:50 - Adela: and for you?
2020/10/28, 16:51 - Jhyan: I couldn't remember stuff and was panicking about the time so I didn't write it with the right sophistication
2020/10/28, 16:51 - Jhyan: So I'm pretty sure it looks unprofessional now
2020/10/28, 16:52 - Jhyan: I feel that
2020/10/28, 16:53 - Adela: like 50 facts is a lot
2020/10/28, 16:54 - Adela: i feel like i didn’t do enough
2020/10/28, 16:54 - Adela: oh i get you
2020/10/28, 16:54 - Adela: i was also struggling to remember everything
2020/10/28, 16:55 - Jhyan: Yeah and it's not like you can count them as your writing right?
2020/10/28, 16:55 - Jhyan: I forgot convenience goods so I wrote "                  goods"
2020/10/28, 16:56 - Jhyan: And then wrote in pencil in that space "[disposable?]"
2020/10/28, 17:52 - Adela: oh dammit, but hopefully that won’t be too bad
2020/10/28, 17:52 - Adela: yeah it’s really difficult
2020/10/28, 17:53 - Adela: like it’s not in bullet point form so you kinda have to hope the information you gave is enough
2020/10/28, 17:54 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/28, 17:54 - Jhyan: Oh it didn't show up but I left a blank space
2020/10/28, 18:56 - Adela: oh i understand
2020/10/28, 18:56 - Adela: but you understood like their definition and stuff?
2020/10/28, 18:57 - Jhyan: Yeah I explained it
2020/10/29, 22:13 - Jhyan: Would you like to go to a book shop with me after exams?
2020/10/29, 22:16 - Adela: yeah sure ofc
2020/10/29, 22:16 - Adela: what are you trying to get?
2020/10/29, 22:20 - Jhyan: Nothing specific. I just thought it would be a creative and easy way to hang out.
2020/10/29, 22:21 - Jhyan: But you could recommend stuff idk
2020/10/29, 22:35 - Adela: it is a creative and easy way to hang out
2020/10/29, 22:35 - Adela: uhm i don’t have any recommendations right now, but i can think about it?
2020/10/29, 22:36 - Jhyan: Well I meant like when we go lmao
2020/10/29, 22:36 - Adela: oh like books?
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Jhyan: What did you think I meant
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Jhyan: Places?
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Adela: oh i thought you meant where to go
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Adela: so yes, this
2020/10/29, 22:37 - Jhyan: Ohhh
2020/10/29, 22:38 - Jhyan: Let's worry about it later I need to sleep
2020/10/29, 22:39 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙
2020/10/29, 22:39 - Adela: good night jhyan ✨
2020/10/30, 18:41 - Adela: after doing ap maths 💀
2020/10/30, 20:35 - Jhyan: What do you do when you can't figure out a question
2020/10/30, 20:35 - Jhyan: For maths
2020/10/30, 20:37 - Jhyan: I'm not ignoring this I just don't know what to say
2020/10/30, 22:32 - Adela: i normally like just try it over and over again. if it’s homework then i will look at the answers and try and see where i went wrong. if it’s a tutorial, i try and give it a day and if it’s a test then i just come back to the question after i’m done with the rest of the paper
2020/10/30, 22:33 - Jhyan: But if you see the right answer then isn't it biased
2020/10/30, 22:33 - Adela: well there is no other option really at that point
2020/10/30, 22:33 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/10/30, 22:33 - Jhyan: The thing is I usually don't have this problem because I just do so many examples
2020/10/30, 22:34 - Jhyan: But because of the time constraints I'm just doing chapter summaries
2020/10/30, 22:34 - Jhyan: But I guess I can go back and do extra examples of the same type as ones I get wrong
2020/10/30, 22:36 - Adela: that’s also what i usually do
2020/10/30, 22:37 - Jhyan: I just invented a 3 way table
2020/10/30, 22:38 - Jhyan: Someone's probably thought of it before, but I've never seen it used and I can't find it just by searching
2020/10/30, 22:39 - Jhyan: You use hexagonal cells and then you can have rows, columns _and_ (halls?)
2020/10/30, 23:23 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/30, 23:23 - Jhyan: AP maths in 2040: 
Contingency tables of 3 events
2020/10/30, 23:25 - Jhyan: Oh I see the problem with it. It doesn't include all intersections
2020/10/30, 23:27 - Adela: this looks so crazy, jhyan
2020/10/30, 23:27 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2020/10/30, 23:30 - Jhyan: Yeah my brain makes connections when it's tired
2020/10/30, 23:31 - Jhyan: I used to come up with so many ideas when I stayed up until 2am
2020/10/30, 23:32 - Jhyan: I have a huge list of stuff that I could create one day
2020/10/30, 23:35 - Jhyan: A while ago I rationalised some decisions in my head by redefining their outcomes and then earlier I thought that I unknowingly performed game theory so I did some research on what exactly it is and found that they tabulate the decisions of 2 or more players and find optional solutions. But then I wondered how they would do more than 2 players and thought of this table. Sadly it doesn't work.
2020/10/31, 00:00 - Adela: on the other hand, i cannot think at all when i’m tired
2020/10/31, 00:00 - Adela: i basically act drunk 😂
2020/10/31, 00:01 - Adela: it’s really unfortunate that it doesn’t work because it seems like a very good concept and idea
2020/10/31, 00:04 - Jhyan: But you're tired all the time 😬
2020/10/31, 00:06 - Adela: yhup which is kinda why my head is just all over the place recently
2020/10/31, 00:19 - Jhyan: Did the raffle work out
2020/10/31, 11:25 - Adela: yeah it did actually. we made like 3k?
2020/10/31, 11:25 - Adela: still waiting for more money next week
2020/10/31, 11:26 - Jhyan: Wow
2020/10/31, 11:26 - Jhyan: I thought it ended yesterday
2020/10/31, 11:27 - Adela: it did technically, but some people promised us money
2020/10/31, 18:30 - Jhyan: Remember in 2016 when people in the US were dressing up as clowns to terrorize people
2020/10/31, 19:05 - Adela: yeah i do remember 😭
2020/10/31, 19:06 - Jhyan: 2016 like so long ago
2020/10/31, 19:07 - Jhyan: *feels
2020/10/31, 19:08 - Jhyan: I forgot it was Halloween
2020/10/31, 19:43 - Jhyan: Are you doing anything for Halloween
2020/10/31, 19:44 - Jhyan: I once did the whole door to door thing because my mom's friend's Street did it
2020/10/31, 19:45 - Adela: no i’m not doing anything. we’ve never really celebrated it
2020/10/31, 19:45 - Adela: how did that go?
2020/10/31, 19:46 - Jhyan: It was fun
2020/10/31, 19:46 - Jhyan: I was disappointed every year after that though
2020/10/31, 19:46 - Jhyan: That we don't celebrate it here except for very specific small communities
2020/10/31, 19:47 - Jhyan: Now we got the classic horror movie lightning to back it up
2020/10/31, 19:48 - Jhyan: And for you, the rain ⛈️
2020/10/31, 20:00 - Adela: i’m at peace with the rain right now
2020/10/31, 20:00 - Adela: that’s really true. yoh
2020/10/31, 20:01 - Adela: how come? did it not live up to that year?
2020/10/31, 20:08 - Jhyan: This
2020/10/31, 20:08 - Jhyan: Ironically, my roof started leaking again
2020/10/31, 20:09 - Jhyan: My grandfather fails to fix it every summer
2020/10/31, 20:09 - Jhyan: So when it starts raining like this it leaks into my room
2020/10/31, 20:09 - Jhyan: My floorboards are warped and basically all my books were destroyed in one instance
2020/10/31, 20:11 - Adela: like reading books or school books?
2020/10/31, 20:12 - Adela: oh no that’s terrible 🥴
2020/10/31, 20:12 - Jhyan: Everything
2020/10/31, 20:20 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/31, 20:23 - Jhyan: It's all good now though
2020/10/31, 20:23 - Jhyan: I got over it
2020/10/31, 20:27 - Jhyan: I'm more angry at the fact that I can't do anything because my mom refuses to get someone professional to look at it because my grandfather does it for free even though I've had this problem for more than 3 years
2020/10/31, 20:30 - Jhyan: Oh look I've referenced it before
2020/10/31, 20:38 - Jhyan: This reminds me of this cool effect that I realised
2020/10/31, 20:39 - Jhyan: Idk if you look at people's about texts, but my previous one was "I'm already cognitively a cyborg" which sounds super edgy now that I think about it but it actually had valid grounding
2020/10/31, 20:44 - Jhyan: That context is that often I forget whether I've said something to someone before or whether I've said it but to a different person, which is one of the reasons I go back through my chats to see if I've already said something
2020/10/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: I tried to think about why this was, and I came up with the fact that, combined with the fact that a large amount of my conversations were via WhatsApp, our brains are wired to remember things with more senses than just what the text looks like and the name of a person. You're supposed to hear a person's voice and see their face and body language and everything. That's the main reason, but it was also that is was stored reliably as a transcript in the chats themselves, and maybe my brain was working less hard to remember what I've said as a result.

I realised that a computer is doing part of my brain's function. It's storing my memories. I'm already cognitively fused with the machine.
2020/10/31, 20:49 - Jhyan: A more terrifying corollary of this is that if I ever lose my chats, I lose a large amount of my memory.
2020/10/31, 20:51 - Jhyan: Idk if you'd find it interesting but I did. Maybe it speaks more to the relationship we have with machines.

Socrates was afraid of paper because he thought it might weaken memory as there would no longer be a need for remembering permanently recorded information. Perhaps he was right
2020/10/31, 21:37 - Adela: that’s terrible, jhyan
2020/10/31, 21:37 - Adela: and when about will your grandfather do it?
2020/10/31, 21:37 - Jhyan: Tomorrow
2020/10/31, 21:39 - Adela: no i do find that really interesting and i experience the same thing too, i often confuse who i said things to and when it happened and i just know i forget a lot of the things i message about, however i recall conversations i have in person a lot more.
and it makes sense that our brain remembers things with all our senses, as opposed to just text which is basically visual and sound (like the clicking of the keyboard)
2020/10/31, 21:39 - Adela: oh that’s not too bad. hopefully it will all be sorted
2020/10/31, 21:40 - Jhyan: We're a pair of robots 🤖🤖
2020/10/31, 21:58 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/31, 21:58 - Jhyan: Robot Ghost for Halloween
2020/10/31, 22:56 - Jhyan: Good night Adela 🌧️
2020/10/31, 23:08 - Adela: 💀💀💀
2020/10/31, 23:08 - Adela: good night jhyan
2020/11/01, 11:48 - Jhyan: Isn't it weird if you think about the current moment as if you're being watched, looked at by your future self
2020/11/01, 11:53 - Jhyan: Or like if the timeline already exists in entirety you're not choosing to do what you're doing. It's like I'm just in a video and my future self is watching the video.
2020/11/01, 12:27 - Jhyan: Do you remember what ⊕ means
2020/11/01, 12:27 - Jhyan: We've had to use it in maths before but I don't remember when
2020/11/01, 15:48 - Jhyan: What is this song btw
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Adela: photograph by jaden
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Jhyan: Thanks
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Adela: it’s really strange. sometimes i think about the fact that we’re constantly living in our memories and never actually in the moment
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Adela: no i dont
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Adela: i remember open and closed dots but not that
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Jhyan: Yeah that's exactly the thought I had that sparked that
2020/11/01, 17:58 - Adela: that looks like protons 💀
2020/11/01, 17:59 - Jhyan: Protons?
2020/11/01, 17:59 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/01, 17:59 - Adela: yeah the plus sign in the circle
2020/11/01, 17:59 - Adela: i think about that often
2020/11/01, 18:00 - Jhyan: It must be either a culturally or humanly significant concept
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: Do you have power
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: A bunch of places lost it
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Adela: yeah i do
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Adela: do you?
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: No
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: It just went out
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: Suddenly
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: A while ago
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Jhyan: Aidan doesn't either
2020/11/01, 18:01 - Adela: i like in parkview so maybe we’re not affected
2020/11/01, 18:02 - Adela: it’s probably related to the thunderstorms
2020/11/01, 18:02 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/01, 18:02 - Jhyan: I went to their Twitter and people from all over were complaining
2020/11/01, 18:04 - Jhyan: Or it's just you and me who think similarly
2020/11/01, 18:04 - Adela: could be that 💀💀💀
2020/11/01, 18:04 - Jhyan: We're both INTJs
2020/11/01, 18:06 - Jhyan: Tangentially related: apparently crabs kept independently being evolved into
2020/11/01, 18:06 - Jhyan: They're an example of convergent evolution
2020/11/01, 18:08 - Jhyan: I forgot why it was related but there's some connection there
2020/11/01, 18:10 - Adela: into?
2020/11/01, 18:10 - Jhyan: A lot of crab precursor organisms would all turn into crabs
2020/11/01, 18:11 - Jhyan: By evolution
2020/11/01, 18:11 - Jhyan: The design of a crab was so useful that natural selection kept developing it in isolation
2020/11/01, 18:12 - Jhyan: I was going to link it to the dominant idea thing but I forgot how
2020/11/01, 18:15 - Jhyan: Another thing that's again related is that patriarchy somehow manifested in every single human society independently and none of the scientific explanations we have hold up more than superficially. It's an anthropological mystery
2020/11/01, 18:16 - Jhyan: I guess the underlying link is that they are phenomena that independently evolve.
2020/11/01, 18:19 - Adela: i see
2020/11/01, 18:19 - Adela: oh that’s really interesting actually
2020/11/01, 18:20 - Adela: that is really weird. but i think that could be influenced by religion too
2020/11/01, 18:22 - Jhyan: But then that could be reduced back to the original statement. Ever human society developing religion and every religion employing patriarchy would still incite the question as to why those religions all needed patriarchy
2020/11/01, 18:27 - Jhyan: Woah look outside it's like pink
2020/11/01, 18:31 - Jhyan: It's gone now
2020/11/01, 18:31 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/01, 18:32 - Adela: i understand what you’re saying
2020/11/01, 18:32 - Jhyan: Yeah but it was diffused so strongly that the light was strong enough to reflect off of other surfaces
2020/11/01, 18:32 - Jhyan: So it was like putting a pink filter on everything
2020/11/01, 18:32 - Jhyan: Not just the sky
2020/11/01, 18:33 - Jhyan: Idk if you caught it
2020/11/01, 18:33 - Jhyan: Idk if I'm explaining it right
2020/11/01, 18:36 - Jhyan: It is interesting to tie it to religion. I didn't think of it like that.
2020/11/01, 19:16 - Jhyan: My power returned ⚡
2020/11/01, 20:01 - Jhyan: If you look on Zazi's status you can see it
2020/11/01, 20:02 - Jhyan: It doesn't show up that well on camera but you'll see what I was talking about
2020/11/02, 00:09 - Adela: thats crazy. i dont know if that happened here
2020/11/02, 00:09 - Adela: i didn’t unfortunately
2020/11/02, 00:10 - Adela: i’m so glad
2020/11/02, 00:10 - Adela: i think a lot of things link to religion because religion defines a lot of the basic principles that form the foundation of the majority of people’s thinking
2020/11/02, 00:10 - Adela: i’ll go and check it out
2020/11/02, 00:11 - Adela: oh that’s beautiful
2020/11/02, 00:13 - Jhyan: It's important to note that objectively we look at religion as a product _of_ human thinking. So it's both defined by the way we think and informs the way others think
2020/11/02, 00:13 - Adela: yeah obviously,
but it was also made a really long time ago. by males
2020/11/02, 07:49 - Jhyan: Now you're starting the chicken or the egg paradox
2020/11/02, 07:53 - Jhyan: ???→men have power to define religious values→Religion defines men as more powerful →men have power to define religious values→religion defines men as more powerful→...
2020/11/02, 13:55 - Jhyan: Finding these 5 passages for English is so annoying
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Jhyan: It took me like 3 hours because I couldn't remember specific passages or where they were in the books
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Adela: tjis is true
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Adela: this*
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Adela: i’m letting that be my problem in a week’s time 💀
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Adela: shame man :/
2020/11/02, 21:04 - Jhyan: Isn't it due today
2020/11/02, 21:05 - Jhyan: By the end the passages and reasons I was coming up with were so flat
2020/11/02, 21:05 - Jhyan: Like at the start it was like X because social commentary on Y

But at the end it was like this was an interesting an cool concept
2020/11/02, 21:06 - Jhyan: And so are the novel summaries
2020/11/02, 21:06 - Jhyan: From Kayla on the group
2020/11/02, 21:06 - Adela: what are you talking about?
2020/11/02, 21:06 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/02, 21:07 - Jhyan: It's fine you probably have the protective shell of the collective
2020/11/02, 21:07 - Jhyan: I doubt everyone is handing them in today
2020/11/02, 21:07 - Adela: oh i did the novel summaries last week
2020/11/02, 21:07 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/02, 21:08 - Adela: i thought you were talking abt feed
2020/11/02, 21:08 - Jhyan: You probably panicked
2020/11/02, 21:08 - Adela: with regards to the novel, i found quotes online and just copied and pasted 💀
2020/11/02, 21:08 - Adela: not really 😂
i’m passed that point
2020/11/02, 21:09 - Jhyan: Last two brain cells 😂
2020/11/02, 21:09 - Jhyan: Eish I was gonna do that but then what if later they ask you to write an essay on it
2020/11/02, 21:09 - Jhyan: Like next year
2020/11/02, 21:11 - Adela: pretty much that
2020/11/02, 21:11 - Adela: i know where all the quotes come in, i just couldn’t be bothered to search for every one specifically
2020/11/02, 21:12 - Jhyan: Idk it wouldn't have worked with my books because they're not big
2020/11/02, 21:12 - Jhyan: So it's not like they've been analysed
2020/11/02, 21:12 - Jhyan: Idk what I'm saying
2020/11/02, 21:12 - Jhyan: I'm busy multitasking rn
2020/11/02, 21:46 - Jhyan: For one of them I copy and pasted like 3 pages because the passage was that long
2020/11/03, 11:44 - Jhyan: Did you finish that test
2020/11/03, 11:51 - Adela: yes i did. did you?
2020/11/03, 11:52 - Jhyan: I got through all the questions but I left some out
2020/11/03, 11:52 - Jhyan: And I forgot to go back and guess the answers to those
2020/11/03, 11:54 - Adela: i guessed a couple of them
2020/11/03, 11:54 - Jhyan: Also it kicked me out after 2 hours
2020/11/03, 11:54 - Jhyan: But we were supposed to have 10 extra minutes
2020/11/03, 11:55 - Jhyan: Other people had a 12 hour timer not a 2 hour one
2020/11/03, 11:56 - Jhyan: What's happening with SQL also because we didn't finish it
2020/11/03, 11:56 - Adela: i have not a clue
2020/11/03, 11:56 - Adela: i had a 14 hour timer
2020/11/03, 11:56 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/03, 11:57 - Jhyan: Mine was 2 hours and then auto kicked me
2020/11/03, 11:57 - Jhyan: What if mine didn't submit
2020/11/03, 12:03 - Adela: that could be the case, but i doubt
2020/11/03, 13:30 - Jhyan: Can you send me a picture of your binary search method
2020/11/03, 13:31 - Adela: for which activity
2020/11/03, 13:31 - Jhyan: She straight up says it doesn't work and that we must figure out why in the video but I don't want to
2020/11/03, 13:31 - Jhyan: Sequential and binary search
2020/11/03, 13:31 - Adela: i don’t think mine works and i couldn’t figure out how
2020/11/03, 13:32 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/03, 13:32 - Jhyan: She could've just taught us the correct method instead of making is try and figure out why it doesn't work
2020/11/03, 13:32 - Jhyan: *us
2020/11/03, 14:00 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/03, 14:00 - Jhyan: That worls
2020/11/03, 14:00 - Jhyan: I think it's something to do with the rounding of integers always going down
2020/11/03, 14:01 - Jhyan: I just made it 'end = mid' instead of 'end = mid - 1' in the if statement
2020/11/03, 14:13 - Adela: lemme try it out
2020/11/03, 14:15 - Adela: it doesn’t work for me idk
2020/11/03, 14:15 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/03, 14:15 - Jhyan: What does it do
2020/11/03, 14:15 - Jhyan: Does it say not found
2020/11/03, 14:16 - Jhyan: Oh the video was kinda confusing but you also have to sort the array
2020/11/03, 14:17 - Jhyan: She barely mentioned it. You have to copy and paste one of the sorting methods from the other classes
2020/11/03, 14:18 - Adela: for which class is this code?
2020/11/03, 14:18 - Jhyan: Sequential and binary search
2020/11/03, 14:18 - Jhyan: Whichever one you had the binary search in
2020/11/03, 14:19 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/03, 14:19 - Jhyan: Bubble sort
2020/11/03, 16:13 - Jhyan: Ok idk but just remember if they ask you to use a bubble sort use the one I sent because the one she coded doesn't work for certain indexes
2020/11/03, 21:03 - Jhyan: Are you ready for tomorrow
2020/11/03, 21:10 - Adela: i don’t think so
2020/11/03, 21:10 - Adela: i managed to fix mine.
thank you
2020/11/03, 21:10 - Adela: and you?
2020/11/03, 21:10 - Jhyan: That's good
2020/11/03, 21:11 - Jhyan: I don't know
2020/11/03, 21:11 - Jhyan: It depends on how she sets it
2020/11/03, 21:11 - Jhyan: Also I don't know if the past papers were 2 or 3 hours but I did one in 2
2020/11/03, 21:12 - Jhyan: I can't tell if this is gonna be the easiest thing to write or the worst and that's why it's scaring me
2020/11/03, 21:12 - Jhyan: If it's something I can help with then you can ask me
2020/11/03, 21:16 - Jhyan: Are you scared
2020/11/03, 21:17 - Jhyan: Ok idk I feel like I'm talking too much but the past papers are really helpful you should at least look at them
2020/11/03, 21:19 - Adela: i am scared. because like a lot of the stuff now is memorisation rather than understanding (like bubble sort vs selection sort) and so on.
2020/11/03, 21:19 - Adela: yes it does
2020/11/03, 21:19 - Jhyan: Can I explain why
2020/11/03, 21:20 - Jhyan: Also if you go on YouTube and search the recent stuff we did + "animation" there's seconds long animations that visually show what the process actually do which might help
2020/11/03, 21:22 - Jhyan: Because she explains really badly imo so I just looked at those and instantly understood how they worked
2020/11/03, 21:23 - Adela: please do
2020/11/03, 21:23 - Jhyan: Plus if you remember the actual process not the method you'll always be able to write a method from scratch
2020/11/03, 21:23 - Adela: she does explain quite badly
2020/11/03, 21:23 - Adela: this is very true
2020/11/03, 21:23 - Adela: let me go check those out
2020/11/03, 21:26 - Jhyan: Ok so they all have a common problem that they want you to code. If you do the 2018 one you'll see instantly what she was attempting to do when she set the prac test. If you understand how to do them it's easily applicable to other ones.
2020/11/03, 21:29 - Jhyan: Idk there's just a specific way they're written I think
2020/11/03, 21:31 - Adela: i get what you’re saying
2020/11/03, 21:31 - Adela: i’ll look over them
2020/11/03, 21:31 - Adela: just stressed rn
2020/11/03, 21:31 - Jhyan: I'm just not sure how helpful I'm being because my brain is tired
2020/11/03, 22:44 - Jhyan: Scanners, arrays, methods, sorting, toString and the difference between static and non static
2020/11/03, 22:45 - Jhyan: Those are all used in the same ways in both the past papers and her prac test
2020/11/03, 22:45 - Jhyan: Everything else is just problem solving besides SQL
2020/11/03, 22:45 - Jhyan: Although she might add searching too so know those
2020/11/03, 22:50 - Adela: what’s the main difference between static and non-static?
2020/11/03, 22:51 - Jhyan: Adding static makes a field or method in a class part of the original class
2020/11/03, 22:51 - Jhyan: Not instances of the class
2020/11/03, 22:53 - Jhyan: If you don't add static then you can make multiple instances with different values for each of their copies of their original field
2020/11/03, 22:55 - Jhyan: So imagine a housing development plan. If you have all the design elements be static then every house made with that plan gets that element, but if the elements are non static then each house gets to have an individually designed element
2020/11/03, 22:55 - Jhyan: So if the doors are static and defined as being red, all houses will get red doors.

If you define the doors without the static then you decide for every house what colour it is.
2020/11/03, 22:56 - Jhyan: That's my understanding of it
2020/11/03, 22:57 - Jhyan: And you need to build a house to change the non static element.

With static ones you can change the plan itself.
2020/11/03, 22:59 - Jhyan: So you need to instantiate a class into an instance with a name and then edit that instance:
>Class cls = new Class()
>cls.setElement(value)

Instead of setting it for the original class:
Class.setElement(value)
2020/11/03, 23:00 - Jhyan: I don't know if I'm making sense maybe also Google it
2020/11/03, 23:02 - Jhyan: And methods will operate within the instances they come from:
>Class cls = new Class ()
>cls.doAction()

Instead of operating on the master/source/original class:
>Class.doAction()
2020/11/03, 23:05 - Jhyan: TL;DR: if you want many copies with their own values use non static and if you want only one copy at any given time use static
2020/11/03, 23:06 - Adela: oh i think i’m starting to get it.
thank you so much jhyan.
i’ll have a look on the internet just to solidify my knowledge, but this really helped so i cannot thank you enough
2020/11/03, 23:07 - Jhyan: It's really the opposite of a problem
2020/11/03, 23:07 - Jhyan: Explaining it to someone else strengthens my knowledge of it
2020/11/03, 23:07 - Jhyan: You're welcome
2020/11/03, 23:08 - Jhyan: 🥂
2020/11/03, 23:09 - Adela: oh i feel the same way sometimes. like you sometimes end up understanding things you didn’t previously through explaining it to someone else
2020/11/03, 23:10 - Jhyan: They did an experiment where they had a bunch of people and told one group they were writing a test and another group they were going to teach the content to other people.

And then they made both groups write a test.

The ones that were told they would teach others did better.
2020/11/03, 23:12 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense, we do learn through people even if we are the ones doing the teaching
2020/11/03, 23:12 - Jhyan: When I told Mr Marais about it he said it's because the second group tried to understand how it worked whereas the first tried to memorize it
2020/11/03, 23:19 - Jhyan: I'm going to sleep now. If you want to ask me anything else you might still catch me.
2020/11/03, 23:20 - Jhyan: 🌙
2020/11/03, 23:28 - Adela: no i’m fine, but thank you so much jhyan
2020/11/03, 23:28 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense
2020/11/03, 23:28 - Jhyan: I'll see you tomorrow then
2020/11/04, 12:20 - Jhyan: I was right about this
2020/11/04, 12:20 - Jhyan: This paper is practically exactly the same as the two past papers
2020/11/04, 18:28 - Jhyan: Did we get our business reports back
2020/11/04, 19:10 - Adela: thank you for reminding me to look at the past papers actually.
2020/11/04, 19:10 - Adela: no we didn’t
2020/11/04, 19:10 - Jhyan: I'm glad I helped
2020/11/04, 19:12 - Jhyan: I've been taking notes of the business content and I have like 600 pages and I haven't done chapter 8 and 9 which are super long
2020/11/04, 19:31 - Adela: oh no. i haven’t really startrd
2020/11/04, 19:32 - Adela: started*
2020/11/04, 19:34 - Jhyan: I mean
2020/11/04, 19:34 - Jhyan: I'm taking notes of all the bullet points and stuff and only using one side of each paper because it's an exam pad
2020/11/04, 19:34 - Jhyan: I've never actually seen you study but you'll be able to do it
2020/11/04, 19:34 - Adela: i’m probably gonna start tomorrow
2020/11/04, 19:35 - Adela: i study pretty fast
2020/11/04, 19:35 - Adela: i’m probably not gonna study THAT much for the iebt
2020/11/04, 19:35 - Jhyan: He was scaring us about it in class
2020/11/04, 19:35 - Jhyan: He thinks universities will look at them more than before because of the pandemic
2020/11/04, 19:36 - Adela: i doubt
2020/11/04, 19:36 - Adela: it wouldnt be fair because public schools don’t write them and they’re normally set at a standard beyond what we actually normally do
2020/11/04, 19:36 - Jhyan: I think in Singapore they just have a week long project as formal assessments instead of exams
2020/11/04, 19:36 - Adela: and public schools aren’t even writing exams this year
2020/11/04, 19:37 - Jhyan: I changed added "I think" because I realised that I've done past papers from Singapore before which clashes with that idea
2020/11/04, 19:38 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/04, 19:38 - Jhyan: I didn't even know this
2020/11/04, 19:40 - Adela: so i doubt they will put that much emphasis on a benchmark test
2020/11/04, 19:40 - Adela: especially with the knowledge that we haven’t been able to cover the content we usually can
2020/11/04, 19:41 - Jhyan: We actually have
2020/11/04, 19:41 - Jhyan: At least us
2020/11/04, 19:41 - Adela: covered, yes. but idk if the right solidification of content has been able to happen
2020/11/04, 19:43 - Jhyan: This is true, but it's hard to measure this or even know this from a university's perspective so they're going to find this out the hard way when they start making less profits for like 2 years.

You can see by the fact that they're still requiring the exact same standards and they haven't changed much for the application process.
2020/11/04, 19:43 - Jhyan: I agree with this though
2020/11/04, 19:46 - Adela: i guess so, but then if the application process hasn’t changed that much... i doubt they will count iebt’s
2020/11/04, 19:46 - Jhyan: I could be wrong in a few ways here. First, they might change processes more internally so nobody would know rn how they're changing applications. They also might still change after discovering what happens after schools write exams and they analyse the data. Or lastly it could just be our school
2020/11/04, 19:47 - Jhyan: The problem is that considering IEBTs more closely would be an internal change which we wouldn't know about. Holly was worried about it because he "had a feeling".
2020/11/04, 19:48 - Jhyan: But I'm not arguing with the core point, I also doubt they'd put emphasis on IEBTs because of the new information you gave me
2020/11/04, 19:49 - Jhyan: I'm just venting because I'm annoyed that they don't look like they're changing anything
2020/11/04, 19:50 - Jhyan: We don't know how well long term memory works with online lessons which is what scares me about this because we wouldn't know until much later
2020/11/04, 19:59 - Jhyan: Maths is on Tuesday right
2020/11/04, 23:23 - Adela: it indeed is
2020/11/04, 23:23 - Adela: i’m just studying business rn. sorry
2020/11/04, 23:24 - Adela: i doubt
2020/11/04, 23:24 - Adela: which is super scary
2020/11/04, 23:24 - Jhyan: Same
2020/11/04, 23:25 - Jhyan: Ok I know I do this a lot but my brain is reminding me of the parallels with the vaccinations
2020/11/04, 23:27 - Jhyan: They have to be tested far in advance rigorously for exactly the same type of problem: unknown long term side effects. We don't know what they might cause so we have to make absolutely sure that there can't be any before we give a huge amount of people them.
2020/11/05, 07:13 - Jhyan: Did you see what sir posted on the maths gc
2020/11/05, 07:14 - Jhyan: They decided he's not teaching us for anything
2020/11/05, 08:45 - Adela: yeah i saw... :(
2020/11/05, 08:46 - Jhyan: We said on the group we're gonna go complain all together on Monday and if that doesn't work then we'll involve parents
2020/11/05, 08:47 - Jhyan: Idk how well you work with chipindu but if she still teaches us AP Aidan and I were thinking about getting a curriculum of online videos that Mr Marais told us about and forming our own thing to learn it from there
2020/11/05, 08:47 - Adela: i saw
2020/11/05, 08:47 - Jhyan: Last resort
2020/11/05, 08:48 - Jhyan: The idea is we would get hard working students together so we can all do it because doing that alone is apparently super hard
2020/11/05, 08:48 - Adela: i’ve never had her as my teacher
2020/11/05, 08:49 - Jhyan: I've heard vehement reactions from both Aidan and Mika'il and she was a substitute for our class in grade 8 for a while and I hated it
2020/11/05, 08:51 - Jhyan: Well anyway don't be too sad we can probably change it. We did it before very easily somehow. Idk why but they practically jumped out of their skins when we did the same thing last time.
2020/11/05, 08:51 - Jhyan: Maybe that's why they tried to keep us in the dark this time
2020/11/05, 08:52 - Jhyan: Well if it comes to it the offer will always be open
2020/11/05, 08:53 - Adela: i sincerely hope that it can be changed
2020/11/05, 08:54 - Jhyan: Me too
2020/11/05, 10:08 - Jhyan: Do you know how many minutes per mark we have
2020/11/05, 10:11 - Jhyan: Because I'm doing post papers and they're all 1.2
2020/11/05, 10:11 - Jhyan: But I'm not sure
2020/11/05, 10:14 - Jhyan: Oh this is for maths I forgot to mention
2020/11/05, 10:33 - Adela: i’m not entirely sure
2020/11/05, 10:33 - Adela: but i think they keep with this most of the time
2020/11/05, 10:33 - Adela: like 150 marks for 180 minutes.
2020/11/05, 10:33 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/11/05, 10:33 - Jhyan: I hope
2020/11/05, 10:34 - Jhyan: M thanks
2020/11/05, 10:35 - Jhyan: *~M~
2020/11/05, 10:36 - Adela: i don’t feel like i helped much
2020/11/05, 10:36 - Adela: but on mr marais’ scope he says that the maths exams are 150 marks each
2020/11/05, 10:36 - Adela: ap is 200 for 2 hours
100 for 1 hour
2020/11/05, 10:37 - Jhyan: Oh then I can just check how long they are and divide
2020/11/05, 10:37 - Adela: both are 3 hours
2020/11/05, 10:37 - Jhyan: Yeah so it's 1.2
2020/11/05, 10:37 - Jhyan: Wait so AP is double?
2020/11/05, 10:38 - Jhyan: The speed
2020/11/05, 10:38 - Jhyan: That's crazy
2020/11/05, 17:18 - Jhyan: Are you winning with business
2020/11/05, 17:18 - Jhyan: How far are you
2020/11/05, 18:10 - Adela: i am actually
2020/11/05, 18:10 - Adela: i managed to get up until chapter 8?
2020/11/05, 18:11 - Jhyan: The start or the end
2020/11/05, 18:11 - Jhyan: 8 and 9 are the longest sections
2020/11/05, 18:11 - Adela: i know but i did them chronologically
2020/11/05, 18:11 - Adela: i’m also not stressed for 8 because i studied it last week
2020/11/05, 18:12 - Jhyan: I studied it for the report but I still couldn't remember anything in it
2020/11/05, 18:12 - Jhyan: So I need to do it again
2020/11/05, 18:12 - Adela: my memory is quite good 💀
2020/11/05, 18:12 - Jhyan: I just didn't study it properly
2020/11/05, 18:13 - Jhyan: This is like your signature line
2020/11/05, 18:14 - Adela: yes it indeed is
2020/11/05, 18:14 - Adela: it’s my biggest flex
2020/11/05, 18:16 - Jhyan: You said it 3 years ago in this chat
2020/11/05, 18:16 - Adela: we spoke 3 years ago?!
2020/11/05, 18:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/05, 18:17 - Jhyan: But don't look back there I was cringe back then
2020/11/05, 18:17 - Adela: oh i found the chat 😂😂😂
2020/11/05, 18:17 - Adela: too late it seems
2020/11/05, 18:17 - Jhyan: Oh no
2020/11/05, 18:18 - Jhyan: Well it's not that bad
2020/11/05, 18:19 - Adela: it isn’t terrible. idk why you’re saying you were cringe when you really weren’t :/
2020/11/05, 18:20 - Jhyan: Well that's the thing
2020/11/05, 18:21 - Jhyan: Do you think you were cringe back then
2020/11/05, 18:21 - Adela: i generally don’t like the person i was before last year term 3
2020/11/05, 18:21 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/05, 18:21 - Jhyan: Most people look back on themselves like that
2020/11/05, 18:24 - Adela: idk i feel like i became the person i wanna be last year term 3
2020/11/05, 18:27 - Jhyan: You don't think you'll change again?
2020/11/05, 18:27 - Adela: i know that i obviously will. but i feel like i’ve been true to myself. before then i was like a shell of myself
2020/11/05, 18:28 - Jhyan: I was myself but, unrefined, more radical and distorted by depression
2020/11/05, 18:28 - Jhyan: But now I know what I'm supposed to be doing
2020/11/05, 18:47 - Jhyan: So I didn't change at a single point, I've just become less and less cringe
2020/11/05, 20:29 - Jhyan: ⛈️
2020/11/05, 20:45 - Adela: i can hear the rain while i’m studying business
2020/11/05, 20:45 - Adela: i’m really glad you’ve gotten to this point, Jhyan.
i genuinely am
2020/11/05, 20:46 - Jhyan: I appreciate that
2020/11/05, 20:48 - Jhyan: :)
2020/11/05, 21:10 - Jhyan: I finally finished chapter 9
2020/11/05, 21:10 - Jhyan: I started yesterday
2020/11/05, 21:13 - Adela: thats hectic
2020/11/05, 21:13 - Adela: i’m still on 8
2020/11/05, 21:13 - Adela: i’m going to study business in the morning
2020/11/05, 21:13 - Adela: maybe i’ll do some iebt preparation
2020/11/05, 21:13 - Jhyan: But I was doing maths most of today though
2020/11/05, 21:14 - Jhyan: I wasn't doing chapter 9 for like 12 hours
2020/11/05, 21:17 - Adela: oh i see
2020/11/05, 21:17 - Adela: are you doing it chronologically
2020/11/05, 21:17 - Adela: business, i mean
2020/11/05, 21:17 - Jhyan: I haven't done that yet and I'm kind scared
2020/11/05, 21:17 - Jhyan: No I still have to do 8
2020/11/05, 21:18 - Jhyan: I haven't studied for AP maths and IT theory
2020/11/05, 21:18 - Adela: me neither
2020/11/05, 21:18 - Adela: eishhh
2020/11/05, 21:18 - Jhyan: I mean technically we did
2020/11/05, 21:19 - Jhyan: We went through the questions
2020/11/05, 21:19 - Jhyan: And did the test
2020/11/05, 21:22 - Adela: technically we did tbh
2020/11/05, 21:22 - Adela: and studied for the last test
2020/11/05, 21:26 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/05, 21:26 - Jhyan: Did you do your English speech yet
2020/11/05, 21:28 - Adela: yeah i went today
2020/11/05, 21:28 - Jhyan: How was it?
2020/11/05, 22:13 - Adela: it was quite nice tbh
i enjoyed the set up of it and i think i spoke well
2020/11/05, 22:14 - Jhyan: Were there people
2020/11/05, 22:14 - Jhyan: An audience
2020/11/05, 22:32 - Jhyan: I'm not ready for mine yet
2020/11/05, 22:34 - Jhyan: Did you find that Sleep Cycle helps
2020/11/05, 22:35 - Jhyan: I keep waking up before mine because the Sun comes up and the brightness wakes me up earlier than I want to wake up
2020/11/05, 22:35 - Adela: it does actually. i have not really overslept badly while using it (touch wood)
2020/11/05, 22:36 - Adela: it also helps me track how much sleep i’m getting
2020/11/05, 22:36 - Adela: thank you so much for that recommendation actually
2020/11/05, 22:36 - Adela: it was just the 5 people i did my slot with - so tanya, sahil, khanya and mpuma
2020/11/05, 22:36 - Jhyan: Oh I see
2020/11/05, 22:37 - Jhyan: I noticed how you struggle with sleep and it reminded me of that
2020/11/05, 22:37 - Adela: you do your prepared speech, prepared reading with motivation and whatnot, an unprepared reading.
then you have a discussion and they just watch you and mark you on your engagement
2020/11/05, 22:37 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/05, 22:55 - Adela: well thank you
2020/11/05, 22:56 - Jhyan: Speaking of sleep
2020/11/05, 22:56 - Jhyan: Good night
2020/11/05, 23:00 - Adela: goodnight Jhyan
2020/11/05, 23:01 - Jhyan: Sleep well Adela
2020/11/06, 12:08 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/06, 12:08 - Jhyan: Probably should've studied though
2020/11/06, 12:08 - Adela: or the leak?
2020/11/06, 12:08 - Adela: i am really unprepared for the iebt
2020/11/06, 12:08 - Jhyan: No the noise
2020/11/06, 12:09 - Jhyan: Idk if I am or not but I'm just hoping I know the content
2020/11/06, 12:09 - Jhyan: .
2020/11/06, 12:09 - Jhyan: But I just did it with a plank before
2020/11/06, 12:09 - Jhyan: Now it's better
2020/11/06, 12:13 - Jhyan: When are you going to school
2020/11/06, 12:13 - Adela: oh i’m really glad
2020/11/06, 12:14 - Adela: i’m aiming to be there at 12:30
2020/11/06, 12:14 - Jhyan: Oh same
2020/11/06, 14:56 - Jhyan: Was it easy
2020/11/06, 14:56 - Jhyan: I was kinda unsure about some of the questions but it was ok
2020/11/06, 15:00 - Adela: i didn’t enjoy it at all
2020/11/06, 15:00 - Jhyan: I'm sorry to hear that
2020/11/06, 15:01 - Jhyan: What made it bad?
2020/11/06, 15:04 - Adela: the questions for me were just quite vague
2020/11/06, 15:05 - Jhyan: I didn't like those ones that asked which values went up and down
2020/11/06, 15:06 - Jhyan: Like as in they didn't give enough contextual information
2020/11/06, 15:06 - Jhyan: IEBTs are like that, but it will be better in the actual exam I think
2020/11/06, 15:13 - Adela: yeah
2020/11/06, 15:28 - Adela: i know the actual exam will be better tbh. i have faith in that.
i hope i’m not proven wrong
2020/11/06, 18:01 - Jhyan: I was just thinking we should get to choose our industry for business
2020/11/06, 18:03 - Jhyan: I know so much more detailed information on video game companies, software companies, online shopping businesses, digital streaming platforms, social media etc.
2020/11/06, 18:03 - Jhyan: And it's exponentially more interesting
2020/11/06, 18:04 - Jhyan: Like I know about how YouTube operates as a business on so many levels
2020/11/06, 18:45 - Adela: that would be very difficult to test though
2020/11/06, 18:45 - Jhyan: Not really
2020/11/06, 18:45 - Adela: and also to come to a final decision because our grade alone does not agree on anything
2020/11/06, 18:45 - Jhyan: No I mean individually
2020/11/06, 18:46 - Jhyan: Actually explain why you think it's not
2020/11/06, 18:46 - Jhyan: Maybe I missed something
2020/11/06, 18:49 - Adela: because for testing and stuff, it would be impossible for fact check every single student because people would bring in facts that are not true by looking at an underrepresented industry
2020/11/06, 18:50 - Jhyan: That is true
2020/11/06, 18:51 - Jhyan: Actually no
2020/11/06, 18:54 - Jhyan: You can't lie in reports
2020/11/06, 18:55 - Adela: you can easily lie or make-up facts
2020/11/06, 18:55 - Jhyan: In what way
2020/11/06, 18:56 - Jhyan: I can't think of a situation where you'd be able to do that
2020/11/06, 18:57 - Adela: all of systems and processes. you can easily lie about the specific process that a business goes through and the marker will not necessarily be able to fact-check you because there are too many topics
2020/11/06, 18:57 - Jhyan: But when do they ask you for processes
2020/11/06, 18:58 - Jhyan: The "facts" are looking for how you relate the business to the concepts we learn
2020/11/06, 18:58 - Jhyan: That's where they place the mark
2020/11/06, 18:59 - Jhyan: Right
2020/11/06, 19:00 - Jhyan: And I'm pretty sure the only reason we have a topic is to ground the concepts in reality as we can relate them to an actual thing
2020/11/06, 19:20 - Jhyan: Ok actually nvm
2020/11/06, 19:20 - Jhyan: I don't care that much
2020/11/06, 19:20 - Jhyan: I don't want to argue
2020/11/06, 19:21 - Jhyan: Text as a medium is so annoying sometimes
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Adela: no it’s not an argument at all
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Adela: i understand the points you’re making
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Jhyan: Exhibit A
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Jhyan: Proving this
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Adela: i just feel like having everyone do something different would be quite confusing for a lot of people as it requires more research individually
2020/11/06, 19:23 - Adela: text is annoying a lot of the time
2020/11/06, 19:24 - Jhyan: I've had times where I wasn't trying to argue with someone but they thought I was
2020/11/06, 19:24 - Jhyan: And then it discouraged them from talking to me
2020/11/06, 19:24 - Adela: it can be the disadvantage of having an assertive personality or strong views. i get the same reaction sometimes
2020/11/06, 19:25 - Jhyan: IRL I would've been able to change my approach or the topic
2020/11/06, 19:25 - Jhyan: Based on their reaction
2020/11/06, 19:26 - Jhyan: But I have no idea if someone is getting increasingly annoyed over text, it's not like people start using 😡 unironically lmao
2020/11/06, 19:26 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/06, 19:27 - Jhyan: You gotta find people who enjoy conversations like that
2020/11/06, 19:28 - Adela: this is very true.
it’s hard to read emotions off of a message
2020/11/06, 19:28 - Adela: yeah this is true as well,
otherwise people feel like it is an argument
2020/11/06, 19:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/06, 19:30 - Jhyan: Ironically it's something people have said at least twice that they like about me when really it contributed to the destruction of the relationship due to incompatibility
2020/11/06, 19:31 - Jhyan: On a YouTube Originals show Mindfield by Michael from Vsauce they actually tested the trolley problem
2020/11/06, 19:32 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/11/06, 19:32 - Jhyan: Wait no
2020/11/06, 19:32 - Jhyan: That one is edited
2020/11/06, 19:32 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/06, 19:33 - Jhyan: You are the guy at the top
2020/11/06, 19:33 - Jhyan: The train is headed to kill multiple people but if you pull the lever it will change course to kill 1 person only
2020/11/06, 19:33 - Jhyan: When asked almost everyone says they would pull the lever
2020/11/06, 19:33 - Jhyan: But experimentally, nobody does
2020/11/06, 19:34 - Jhyan: Well 1 person did
2020/11/06, 19:36 - Jhyan: They set up a fake room with a camera showing fake surveillance footage of a construction team on 2 tracks (one of the construction workers was on one of the tracks) and a button that would do the same thing.

Candidates were unaware that it was a test. They were told they were still waiting for the actual test and that they were needed to just watch over the controls while the guy in there went to get a coffee or something.
2020/11/06, 19:37 - Jhyan: It's actually an extremely important experiment imo because it highlights the difference between what people say they would do and what they actually do.
2020/11/06, 19:37 - Jhyan: Linking back to this, their perceptions of that quality being a good thing was not what was reflected in reality
2020/11/06, 19:40 - Jhyan: https://www.moralmachine.net/

This gives you scenarios similar to that and the data is planned to be used to decide how self driving cars would make these decisions; so that they're democratic; based on the collective decisions
2020/11/06, 19:40 - Jhyan: Plus it's fun
2020/11/06, 19:40 - Jhyan: You get to examine your own evaluation of human life with different factors
2020/11/06, 19:45 - Adela: i’ve heard a lot about the trolley problem
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Adela: i don’t have time to watch this currently because i’m just studying the last of business rn 🥴
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Adela: but i will really try to get back to it
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Jhyan: It's not a video it's a test
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Jhyan: You choose options
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Jhyan: But yeah do it whenever
2020/11/06, 19:46 - Jhyan: Or don't
2020/11/06, 20:00 - Adela: it seems quite interesting
2020/11/06, 20:00 - Adela: i’ll definitely try and do it
2020/11/06, 20:02 - Jhyan: 👌🏻
2020/11/06, 22:59 - Jhyan: Are you ready for the test tomorrow
2020/11/06, 23:01 - Adela: i think so
2020/11/06, 23:01 - Adela: i’ve studied a whole lot now
2020/11/06, 23:01 - Adela: i sincerely hope i am readh
2020/11/06, 23:01 - Adela: ready*
2020/11/06, 23:01 - Adela: are you?
2020/11/06, 23:02 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/06, 23:02 - Jhyan: Probably
2020/11/06, 23:02 - Jhyan: The report is the only worrying thing
2020/11/06, 23:02 - Jhyan: Because it's unknown
2020/11/06, 23:02 - Jhyan: And I messed up last week
2020/11/06, 23:04 - Jhyan: I just had a really weird thing where I imagined asking you a different question and then when the notification happened I thought you responded to that but realised it was only in my imagination
2020/11/06, 23:05 - Adela: what was the question?
2020/11/06, 23:05 - Adela: yeah that is the worrying one
2020/11/06, 23:05 - Jhyan: I didn't ask it because it might've started a longer conversation and we're in the middle of exams and it's late
2020/11/06, 23:06 - Adela: oh i get you
2020/11/06, 23:06 - Adela: well when the time is right
2020/11/06, 23:06 - Jhyan: I wondered if you've just had read receipts off for years and if you've ever turned them back on and the more detailed motivation you had behind them
2020/11/06, 23:07 - Jhyan: Idk it was just a thought
2020/11/06, 23:07 - Jhyan: It could be personal also
2020/11/06, 23:07 - Jhyan: Which added towards not asking
2020/11/06, 23:08 - Adela: i kinda just turned them off to avoid like feeling rejected in my own sense, like it’s the peace of mind of “living in ignorance”, kinda works for me. i did it when i was in grade 8 and it was also to avoid like making people feel bad when i don’t answer their messages and leaving it on “read”
2020/11/06, 23:08 - Adela: and then i’ve never sort of felt the need to put them back on really
2020/11/06, 23:08 - Jhyan: I tried turning them off like last week
2020/11/06, 23:09 - Jhyan: For that first reason
2020/11/06, 23:09 - Jhyan: Well a version of it
2020/11/06, 23:09 - Jhyan: Mpuma has them off so I asked him how it was for him and he said it was nice
2020/11/06, 23:09 - Jhyan: But I don't like having them off
2020/11/06, 23:14 - Jhyan: Your motivations are interesting to me
2020/11/06, 23:15 - Adela: i guess that was how my grade 8 brain worked and then i got used to not having them
2020/11/06, 23:15 - Adela: what version
2020/11/06, 23:15 - Adela: how come?
2020/11/06, 23:16 - Jhyan: Let me check I explained it to him
2020/11/06, 23:17 - Jhyan: Yeah I was more considering doing it to not know if people ignore me
2020/11/06, 23:17 - Jhyan: Or just to not have that expectation of people reading my messages
2020/11/06, 23:19 - Jhyan: I felt like I was being unfair to people who did have them on. Plus it made me wondering if they ignored me worse because now I would never know but before I'd have an intuitive sense of how long different people take to read messages so after a certain point I'd know that it was probably intentional
2020/11/06, 23:21 - Jhyan: Plus sometimes I send multiple messages but they switch chats in the middle of the conversation and I don't know if I need to add context or if they haven't read something yet
2020/11/06, 23:30 - Adela: this is true. i just guess that i go with my gut sense when it comes to someone either reading or not reading my message
2020/11/06, 23:30 - Adela: and i don’t take things to heart
2020/11/06, 23:30 - Adela: this can be confusing 😭
2020/11/06, 23:30 - Jhyan: I never know when to stop adding information IRL but for a different reason
2020/11/06, 23:31 - Jhyan: So sometimes I'll keep adding increasingly useless facts about what I'm saying
2020/11/06, 23:31 - Jhyan: Because someone doesn't respond
2020/11/06, 23:35 - Adela: i get what you’re saying. just to create some sort of reaction or like a point that they can expand on
2020/11/06, 23:35 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/06, 23:35 - Jhyan: It's not like they're ignoring me
2020/11/06, 23:40 - Adela: sometimes it can be difficult to respond in general, not to you. i just tend to be a bad conversationist sometimes 😭😭
2020/11/06, 23:41 - Jhyan: I wasn't talking about you 🙃
2020/11/06, 23:45 - Adela: no i wasn’t implying that you were, i’m just relating the concept
2020/11/06, 23:46 - Jhyan: Don't worry about it you're good
2020/11/06, 23:46 - Jhyan: I gtg sleep
2020/11/06, 23:47 - Jhyan: See you tomorrow
2020/11/06, 23:50 - Adela: goodnight jhyan. see you tomorrow
2020/11/06, 23:50 - Jhyan: 🟢
2020/11/07, 12:17 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/11/07, 12:17 - Jhyan: How did you find it
2020/11/07, 13:19 - Jhyan: Time to study for AP maths
2020/11/07, 13:19 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/07, 19:53 - Jhyan: https://photos.app.goo.gl/sE7PMV6ttauBAf4e9

If you don't want to spend ungodly amounts of time reading and interpreting the redundancy-plagued textbook or even if you already know stuff and just want to quickly find a concept
2020/11/07, 20:20 - Jhyan: In retrospect I don't know how useful they'll be to other people
2020/11/07, 20:58 - Adela: thank so so much jhyan
2020/11/07, 20:58 - Adela: i found the exam really good actually. how did you find it?
2020/11/07, 20:58 - Adela: this week is hectic. we’re writing from monday to friday
2020/11/07, 20:58 - Jhyan: I did it for that other test because I vowed never to have to read that textbook ever again
2020/11/07, 20:59 - Jhyan: I'm just worried the quality of my answers was degraded because I did it in 2 hours, especially the report
2020/11/07, 20:59 - Jhyan: Because I probably would've added more detail to the report
2020/11/07, 21:00 - Jhyan: Yeah idk how I'm going to get time to finish studying AP maths by Friday and physics and maths 2 by next week
2020/11/07, 21:00 - Jhyan: I went back to start AP and relating complex numbers because I forgot most of it
2020/11/07, 21:00 - Jhyan: *relearned
2020/11/07, 21:01 - Adela: i hate that textbook
2020/11/07, 21:02 - Adela: i hope for your sake it is not
2020/11/07, 21:02 - Jhyan: If I still get get good marks
2020/11/07, 21:02 - Jhyan: Like more than 75% it's extremely good though
2020/11/07, 21:03 - Jhyan: Because I'll know if I had all three hours I would've done even better
2020/11/07, 21:04 - Adela: yeah i feel what you’re saying
2020/11/07, 21:04 - Adela: but didn’t you know the paper was 3 hours?
2020/11/07, 21:04 - Jhyan: I did
2020/11/07, 21:04 - Jhyan: But I just didn't notice that 10:50 wasn't 3 hours after 8:50
2020/11/07, 21:04 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/07, 21:05 - Jhyan: ... Or that it said grade 10 at the top
2020/11/07, 21:05 - Jhyan: Also I was expecting to almost run out of time like I did in 2 hours so I didn't find it odd that I didn't have time
2020/11/07, 21:06 - Jhyan: And the fact that I had to pee for so long and I thought I wasn't allowed to go and needed all the extra seconds 😬😐
2020/11/07, 21:07 - Jhyan: That's actually how I realised because I was wondering why he "broke" the rules to let me to to the bathroom and realised he didn't
2020/11/07, 21:08 - Jhyan: My brain's probably processing  this one into the cringe vault as we speak
2020/11/08, 00:23 - Adela: shame but don’t worry about it, i’m sure you did just fine even with all of the rushing
2020/11/08, 07:03 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/11/08, 08:00 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/08, 11:46 - Adela: this is actually quite true
2020/11/08, 11:46 - Adela: sometimes
2020/11/08, 11:46 - Adela: depends on the assignment 😭
2020/11/08, 11:46 - Jhyan: I recall a relo presentation we were supposed to do
2020/11/08, 11:46 - Jhyan: I started it in the lesson we were supposed to be presenting
2020/11/08, 11:47 - Jhyan: She wanted to check my slides so I showed her the first 3 and she went away and I got away with it
2020/11/08, 11:47 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/08, 14:49 - Adela: which one? last year?
2020/11/08, 14:49 - Adela: i’m guessing ms kaps
2020/11/08, 14:51 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/11/08, 14:51 - Jhyan: I have no idea when
2020/11/08, 18:15 - Jhyan: Are you still sending an email
2020/11/08, 18:15 - Adela: i may send one later on
2020/11/08, 18:15 - Jhyan: Ok cool
2020/11/08, 18:15 - Adela: but the email is a good reflection of what i would say tbh
2020/11/08, 18:15 - Jhyan: I'm glad
2020/11/08, 21:51 - Jhyan: Are you seeing this lightning
2020/11/08, 21:51 - Jhyan: I just saw one sustain for like 5 whole seconds right above me
2020/11/08, 21:51 - Adela: i can’t really see the lightning from where i am right now, but i can hear loads of thunder
2020/11/08, 21:51 - Jhyan: It's flickering literally every second
2020/11/08, 21:52 - Jhyan: Like microwave popcorn
2020/11/08, 21:52 - Jhyan: Also it just started raining much harder
2020/11/08, 21:52 - Jhyan: Like in movies
2020/11/08, 22:05 - Adela: that’s crazy. i’m somewhat shielded from the rain right now because i have music and i have no window to look out of
2020/11/08, 22:06 - Jhyan: I live on a mountain so the lightning always trips my power
2020/11/08, 22:06 - Jhyan: When it's that bad
2020/11/08, 22:06 - Jhyan: One time it struck across the street and just destroyed a tree
2020/11/08, 22:07 - Jhyan: Apparently it was burning for hours and it was smouldering the next morning so much that when we drove past it with the car window open I felt a wave of heat
2020/11/08, 22:21 - Adela: that makes sense given that you are on a higher altitude
2020/11/08, 22:21 - Adela: that’s really insane
2020/11/08, 22:22 - Jhyan: I know
2020/11/08, 22:22 - Jhyan: I was so surprised
2020/11/08, 22:23 - Jhyan: I didn't wake up in the middle of the night when it struck though
2020/11/08, 22:24 - Jhyan: Have you started studying AP yet
2020/11/08, 22:24 - Jhyan: I just realised how there's no time 😐
2020/11/08, 22:24 - Jhyan: Idk how I'm gonna do the whole of AP
2020/11/08, 22:25 - Jhyan: And he said I must get a distinction
2020/11/08, 22:25 - Jhyan: Idk how
2020/11/09, 16:13 - Jhyan: Do you think there's a way to do this without a tree diagram
2020/11/09, 16:13 - Jhyan: That we know of
2020/11/09, 16:28 - Adela: i don’t think so personally
2020/11/09, 16:29 - Adela: no i have not
2020/11/09, 16:29 - Jhyan: I'm trying to do i again
2020/11/09, 16:29 - Jhyan: I'm getting further than last time
2020/11/09, 16:30 - Adela: i’m going through term 1’s work because i feel like i forgot a lot
2020/11/09, 16:30 - Jhyan: Probability
2020/11/09, 16:33 - Adela: i’m okay with core maths probability tbh
2020/11/09, 16:34 - Jhyan: I DID (i)
2020/11/09, 16:34 - Jhyan: I DID IT
2020/11/09, 16:35 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/09, 16:35 - Jhyan: And then I got to that at the end
2020/11/09, 16:35 - Jhyan: Omg that's so good
2020/11/09, 16:35 - Jhyan: I must've done it wrong before when I did it in my head because what I did now is new
2020/11/09, 16:37 - Jhyan: I hope they add (i) into the exam now 😭
2020/11/09, 16:39 - Adela: i doubt they will
2020/11/09, 16:39 - Adela: but i’m really happy that you managed to figure it out
2020/11/09, 19:33 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/09, 19:38 - Adela: you can only solve in terms of their relative values
2020/11/09, 19:39 - Jhyan: Can they give us a question like that then
2020/11/09, 19:39 - Jhyan: Also it might be something to do with the fact that quadratics have 2 solutions so maybe there's 2 different equations hidden in one
2020/11/09, 19:40 - Adela: you can’t do that because there are no two values given
2020/11/09, 19:40 - Adela: in order to do a simultaneous equation, you have to have two separate equations
2020/11/09, 19:40 - Jhyan: Yeah but if you square root it you might get two equations, one being negative and the other being positive
2020/11/09, 19:40 - Jhyan: I just can't see if that's the case
2020/11/09, 19:40 - Adela: not really
2020/11/09, 19:42 - Jhyan: Why not
2020/11/09, 19:43 - Adela: like you can’t equate two routes because they are not necessarily equal
2020/11/09, 19:43 - Adela: roots*
2020/11/09, 19:44 - Adela: because the roots of x^2 + 7x + 8 would
x = -8 and x = 1
and those are not equal
2020/11/09, 19:46 - Jhyan: What if you had 2 quadratic graphs that intersect at 2 points
2020/11/09, 19:47 - Adela: yes they do but those intersections are not equal to one another unless it is said to be a perfect square
2020/11/09, 19:47 - Adela: and it also cannot be assumed that they are direct opposites like -2 and 2 because that makes the assumption that the graph has not been horizontally translated
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Jhyan: Ok I graphed it on geogebra
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Jhyan: I think you're right
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Jhyan: The x value wouldn't be the same
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Adela: it wouldn’t
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/09, 19:52 - Adela: i even plugged it into photomaths and there is no proper solution. the best that you can do is solve it for x and then y
2020/11/09, 19:53 - Jhyan: I didn't know they could give us a question like this
2020/11/09, 19:53 - Jhyan: If it was then it wouldn't even be a function anymore
2020/11/09, 19:53 - Jhyan: Because there would be 2 outputs for 1 input
2020/11/09, 19:54 - Adela: that’s what i was saying
2020/11/09, 19:54 - Adela: i doubt they can
2020/11/09, 19:54 - Jhyan: This was in St Stithians Grade 11 past paper
2020/11/09, 19:55 - Jhyan: From last year
2020/11/09, 19:56 - Jhyan: But it's fine I finished the paper in under 2h so
2020/11/09, 19:56 - Jhyan: It was 3hr
2020/11/09, 20:04 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/11/09, 20:06 - Adela: you’re welcome
2020/11/09, 20:06 - Adela: oh i see
2020/11/09, 20:06 - Adela: that’s quite good
2020/11/09, 20:06 - Adela: was it difficult?
2020/11/09, 20:06 - Jhyan: No
2020/11/09, 20:07 - Jhyan: It was easy
2020/11/09, 20:13 - Jhyan: Based on my rate and a projected mark of 90% I would get 81% for AP but I'm not taking into account no CA and the fact that it's harder which is
2020/11/09, 20:14 - Jhyan: *which is unquantifiable
2020/11/09, 20:14 - Adela: ap is a lot harder than it seems
2020/11/09, 20:14 - Jhyan: Well I'm sure you could analyse data and get the factor that it affects maths but idk
2020/11/09, 20:15 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/09, 20:15 - Adela: what do you mean?
2020/11/09, 20:16 - Jhyan: Like if you took enough projections based on the way I did it and compared them to the actual result each pair would have a discrepancy that you could average out to a certain percentage
2020/11/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: Or even better analyse it against the amount of time or marks that the rest was allocated because it might not be constant
2020/11/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/11/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: Or you could plot them and do a curved regression but we don't know how to do that
2020/11/09, 20:19 - Jhyan: Plot each actual result against the projected result and find the curve
2020/11/09, 20:21 - Jhyan: Anyway it would give you a quantifiable way to project the amount that the extra hurdles in AP affect the mark
2020/11/09, 20:21 - Jhyan: The ieb probably knows what it is
2020/11/09, 20:21 - Adela: i kinda get what you’re saying but i’m also a bit confused
2020/11/09, 20:21 - Jhyan: Should I try explain it better
2020/11/09, 20:22 - Adela: if you would like to
2020/11/09, 20:24 - Jhyan: You have expected result on the x axis and actual result in the y axis and plotted a scatter diagram of all of the points. Then you do a curved regression which is finding the line of best fit but it's a non linear line. That gives you the function for the result they will get given the input of the simple original projection.
2020/11/09, 20:25 - Jhyan: Then you can interpolate your actual result based on the one you calculate just based on your rate.
2020/11/09, 20:28 - Jhyan: Should I do another past paper
2020/11/09, 20:30 - Adela: if you feel comfortable then don’t, i find going through the revision exercises at the end of the chapters mr marais specifies to be beneficial because you get a more holistic experience of the topic rather than a past paper which varies a lot in difficulty
2020/11/09, 20:30 - Adela: oh i get it now
2020/11/09, 20:33 - Jhyan: The thing is I do multiple past papers and I've already finished all the chapter exercises
2020/11/09, 20:33 - Jhyan: I've done like 4 past papers by now
2020/11/09, 20:33 - Adela: yeah but a lot is not covered in past papers which are in the syllabus
2020/11/09, 20:34 - Jhyan: But only if you do a small amount because they will overlap mostly but will also have extra parts that don't overlap
2020/11/09, 20:36 - Jhyan: If all past papers didn't include the same certain stuff then that would mean that stuff wouldn't be necessary to study
2020/11/09, 20:36 - Jhyan: Although it's still not guaranteed you will cover everything, but I've already done all the chapter summaries
2020/11/09, 20:38 - Jhyan: I'm just worried that it would interfere with my sleep because I would end late
2020/11/09, 20:41 - Jhyan: What are you doing rn just chapter summaries?
2020/11/09, 20:44 - Adela: i did the past paper and then the chapter revision exercises
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Jhyan: Like all of them
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Jhyan: In a few hours
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Adela: yeah mist of the difficult topics
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Jhyan: Did you do functions
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Adela: yeah
2020/11/09, 20:45 - Jhyan: Because that chapter summary is super long
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Jhyan: From the new mind action
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Adela: i don’t do all of the chapter summaries
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Adela: i do the difficult ones or ones that stand out for me
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Jhyan: But he told us which textbooks to study from
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Adela: because it’s pointless redoing the things that i understand
2020/11/09, 20:46 - Adela: i know that
2020/11/09, 20:47 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/09, 20:47 - Jhyan: Yeah the thing is there's no way to tell if I forgot something because I would've forgotten it
2020/11/10, 12:13 - Jhyan: That test was so easy
2020/11/10, 12:13 - Jhyan: Well it was nice
2020/11/10, 12:13 - Jhyan: I answered every question confidently
2020/11/10, 13:17 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/10, 13:17 - Adela: i enjoyed the exam
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Jhyan: Now it's time for paper 2
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Adela: the textbook seems like it was published without editting
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Adela: editing*
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Adela: paper 2 is the more hectic one
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Jhyan: Which Marais sets
2020/11/10, 13:18 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/10, 13:19 - Jhyan: >everyone shows up for the maths paper 2

>Marais is grinning at the front, holding all the tests

>We all get the paper

>"Make sure your calculator is in DEGREES mode"

>"Reading time begins now"

>Classical music slowly gets louder, almost inaudible at first, builds up in tension

>Dark Souls-like boss music starts

>"You may now start writing"
2020/11/10, 13:19 - Adela: marais sets really difficult papers
2020/11/10, 13:19 - Adela: did you spot an issue in the one question?
2020/11/10, 13:19 - Adela: the one that asked us to find the quadratic function
2020/11/10, 13:20 - Jhyan: I thought of this situation a while ago when I was listening to video game boss music while doing past papers
2020/11/10, 13:20 - Jhyan: Weren't there multiply
2020/11/10, 13:20 - Jhyan: *multiple
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Jhyan: The one with the bow and arrow required an assumption that they didn't give us
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Adela: i only saw the error in the one that wanted us to find the quadratic function
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Adela: there was no error in that question
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Jhyan: They didn't say that C was the turning point
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Jhyan: Or that CD passes through the turning point
2020/11/10, 13:21 - Jhyan: Which one
2020/11/10, 13:22 - Adela: oh i get you
2020/11/10, 13:22 - Adela: the one that went 4: 5; 7; 10 or something
2020/11/10, 13:22 - Jhyan: Oh why
2020/11/10, 13:23 - Jhyan: 3 4 3 7 10
2020/11/10, 13:23 - Jhyan: Was it that one
2020/11/10, 13:23 - Jhyan: No wait
2020/11/10, 13:24 - Adela: yes
2020/11/10, 13:24 - Adela: it had an error because it put four before and after 3
2020/11/10, 13:25 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/10, 13:25 - Jhyan: I don't know why I didn't realise it
2020/11/10, 13:27 - Adela: i noted the error
2020/11/10, 13:31 - Jhyan: What that's crazy
2020/11/10, 13:31 - Jhyan: Yeah it was wrong
2020/11/10, 13:31 - Jhyan: Because the pattern would go 3 4 3 0
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Jhyan: Are you sure it wasn't 4 3 4
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Adela: it was 4 3 4
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Adela: but that’s not a quadratic function
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Jhyan: But then it works
2020/11/10, 13:32 - Adela: 4 was repeated
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Jhyan: Yeah because 3 was the minimum value
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: it was 4 3 4 7 10
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: mo wait
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: no wait
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: 4 3 4 5 8
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: something like that
2020/11/10, 13:33 - Adela: no i keep messing up
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Jhyan: 4 3 4 7 12
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Adela: 4 3 4 7 12
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Adela: yes
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Adela: but that’s not a quadratic function
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Adela: because there is no constant difference
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Jhyan: No it's meant to be 13
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Jhyan: I made a typo
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Adela: that doesn’t work
2020/11/10, 13:34 - Jhyan: 4 3 4 7 13
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Adela: that doesn’t have a second order difference
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Jhyan: Oh yeah it is 12
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Jhyan: I'm stupid
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Adela: there was an error idk
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Jhyan: But it is a quadratic function
2020/11/10, 13:35 - Adela: nvm
2020/11/10, 13:36 - Jhyan: Wait so did you get it
2020/11/10, 13:36 - Adela: idk
2020/11/10, 13:36 - Jhyan: Oh no :( I feel bad now
2020/11/10, 13:37 - Jhyan: Even though I didn't do anything
2020/11/10, 13:37 - Adela: no don’t feel bad
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Jhyan: Did you get the one with the pens
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Adela: yeah i did
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Jhyan: That one was confusing so I went back afterwards
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Jhyan: I got 159 pens
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Adela: i also did
2020/11/10, 13:38 - Jhyan: Ok good
2020/11/10, 13:39 - Jhyan: And the 900 million thing was 2
2020/11/10, 13:39 - Jhyan: I think they specifically designed it to fail on calculators because if you put it into your calculator it says 0
2020/11/10, 13:39 - Jhyan: But it's actually 2
2020/11/10, 13:40 - Adela: yhup i got that too
2020/11/10, 13:40 - Jhyan: 🥂
2020/11/10, 13:43 - Jhyan: I had so much time that I added the line of symmetry to the parabola we had to draw
2020/11/10, 14:17 - Jhyan: This textbook could form an entire textual editing section in English
2020/11/10, 14:34 - Adela: this is so true 😭😭
2020/11/10, 16:38 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Jhyan: "less time constraints so students can work at any time"
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Adela: i don’t think so 😭
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Adela: online learning was so much worse
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Jhyan: I know
2020/11/10, 16:39 - Jhyan: Idk how I had commitment
2020/11/10, 16:40 - Jhyan: Khanya said he enjoyed this aspect though
2020/11/10, 17:59 - Adela: i didn’t feel that honestly, i felt really stressed out
2020/11/10, 17:59 - Adela: but i did have more time on my hands in term 2 though
2020/11/10, 18:00 - Jhyan: I don't even remember that time period tbh
2020/11/10, 18:00 - Jhyan: It was too monotonous
2020/11/10, 19:24 - Jhyan: Do you wann join this meet thing we're doing to study IT
2020/11/10, 20:04 - Adela: uhm i think i’m good, but thank you 🥺
2020/11/10, 20:05 - Adela: i study best by myself, i think
2020/11/10, 20:05 - Adela: but the best of luck to all of you
2020/11/10, 20:05 - Jhyan: Ok cool
2020/11/10, 20:12 - Jhyan: Oh good luck to you too
2020/11/10, 20:12 - Jhyan: I forgot to say that
2020/11/10, 23:15 - Adela: thank you ❤️
2020/11/11, 13:07 - Jhyan: Did you get everything in that exam
2020/11/11, 13:56 - Adela: no
2020/11/11, 13:58 - Jhyan: Ok well at least we're done IT for the year
2020/11/11, 14:06 - Adela: i’m really happy abt that
2020/11/11, 14:06 - Jhyan: I'm just doing AP maths
2020/11/11, 14:06 - Jhyan: I keep wanting exams to be over already
2020/11/11, 14:18 - Adela: i’m done in 8 days
2020/11/11, 14:22 - Jhyan: I finish on the 21st
2020/11/11, 14:22 - Jhyan: But I don't really care about AP English so
2020/11/11, 17:36 - Jhyan: Do you know where we can get counting principles examples
2020/11/11, 17:36 - Jhyan: Or do you have the grade 10 notes
2020/11/11, 17:45 - Adela: no i unfortunately do not
2020/11/11, 17:46 - Adela: maybe try the internet?
2020/11/11, 17:46 - Jhyan: I did but it's risky
2020/11/11, 17:46 - Adela: we also did some counting principles in term 1 so check those grade 11 notes
2020/11/11, 17:46 - Jhyan: I wrote how to do them but I don't have any exercises
2020/11/11, 17:46 - Adela: there should be exercises under term 1
2020/11/11, 17:47 - Jhyan: He doesn't put his posts in categories so I would have to manually scroll all the way back
2020/11/11, 17:48 - Jhyan: Oh it's actually short
2020/11/11, 17:48 - Adela: yeah and it’s in the grade 10 textbook
2020/11/11, 17:49 - Jhyan: I asked him about this and I don't remember what he said but it's missing concepts or something
2020/11/11, 17:49 - Jhyan: Oh I found the exercises
2020/11/11, 17:49 - Jhyan: Thanks
2020/11/12, 16:32 - Jhyan: Do you ever finish AP papers
2020/11/12, 16:37 - Adela: i’ve never not finished an ap paper
touch wood
2020/11/12, 16:37 - Jhyan: What
2020/11/12, 16:37 - Jhyan: How
2020/11/12, 16:38 - Jhyan: Is there anything you haven't been able to finish
2020/11/12, 16:38 - Jhyan: Or you were still writing when the time ended
2020/11/12, 16:42 - Adela: nope
2020/11/12, 16:42 - Jhyan: I'm amazed
2020/11/12, 16:43 - Jhyan: So I guess you'll catch some shuteye in the exams tomorrow too
2020/11/12, 16:53 - Adela: i doubt
2020/11/12, 22:37 - Jhyan: Are you still studying
2020/11/12, 22:39 - Adela: not really
2020/11/12, 22:39 - Jhyan: Do you know the content
2020/11/12, 22:39 - Adela: i think so
2020/11/12, 22:39 - Adela: i really don’t wanna think abt it
2020/11/12, 22:39 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/12, 22:40 - Adela: i’m just tired of this week
2020/11/12, 22:44 - Jhyan: Oh I get you
2020/11/12, 22:44 - Jhyan: Yeah I'm stressed about this AP exam
2020/11/12, 22:44 - Jhyan: I don't know if I'll remember everything
2020/11/12, 22:44 - Jhyan: Because we had too much to do and I didn't have time to study properly
2020/11/12, 22:45 - Jhyan: Matric will be better
2020/11/12, 22:45 - Jhyan: I kinda just want to finish this year
2020/11/12, 22:45 - Jhyan: This is what I'm thinking to keep me from being too stressed
2020/11/12, 22:47 - Adela: yeah it definitely will. the timetable will be better
2020/11/12, 22:47 - Adela: yeah same lol
2020/11/12, 22:48 - Adela: all our exams were back-to-back so there was literally no time to study besides the actual day before
2020/11/12, 22:48 - Jhyan: The fact that we had 500 English assignments
2020/11/12, 22:48 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/12, 22:48 - Jhyan: The week before
2020/11/12, 22:54 - Adela: thats why i literally could not even look at exams
2020/11/12, 22:55 - Adela: assignments ran onto the very last week of school
2020/11/12, 22:55 - Jhyan: And they were like
2020/11/12, 22:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/12, 22:57 - Adela: this was the worst term i have ever experienced
2020/11/12, 22:58 - Jhyan: I agree
2020/11/13, 14:41 - Jhyan: Was the second one better or worse than the first one
2020/11/13, 14:42 - Jhyan: I did well in the first one but worse in the second one
2020/11/13, 14:42 - Jhyan: Well not just worse
2020/11/13, 14:43 - Adela: i feel the exact opposite
2020/11/13, 14:50 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/13, 14:50 - Jhyan: I forgot how to do stuff in statistics
2020/11/13, 14:57 - Adela: ohh no
2020/11/13, 14:57 - Adela: in paper 1 my mind just went blank
2020/11/13, 14:57 - Jhyan: That was me but paper 2
2020/11/13, 14:57 - Jhyan: Like every time I tried to have a thought it was interrupted by thinking about the time
2020/11/13, 14:58 - Jhyan: The worst part is that I understood the questions but I couldn't remember how to set out the work
2020/11/13, 14:58 - Jhyan: And stuff
2020/11/13, 14:59 - Jhyan: Anyway at least it's over now
2020/11/13, 14:59 - Jhyan: I can focus on other stuff
2020/11/13, 14:59 - Jhyan: But I'm too drained to study rn
2020/11/13, 14:59 - Adela: oh i get you
2020/11/13, 15:00 - Adela: i really am too drained too
2020/11/13, 15:01 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/13, 15:01 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/13, 15:01 - Jhyan: I feel like that sums up today in a nutshell
2020/11/13, 15:02 - Adela: my mom got some feedback on the ap maths thing
2020/11/13, 15:03 - Adela: but i think ms blanckensee is going to get back to everyone
2020/11/13, 15:03 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/13, 15:08 - Jhyan: What are you doing now
2020/11/13, 15:10 - Adela: i’m eating and then i’m going to just relax
2020/11/13, 17:22 - Adela: they want to merge our ap maths classes
2020/11/13, 17:23 - Jhyan: Do they realise that's not going to work
2020/11/13, 17:24 - Adela: the school has things they want that are not logical
2020/11/13, 17:24 - Adela: the ap maths classes can never merge
2020/11/13, 17:25 - Jhyan: Yeah I'm just thinking about what it entails
2020/11/13, 17:25 - Jhyan: They really cornered themselves on this one
2020/11/13, 17:25 - Jhyan: The only real solution is to hire a new teacher
2020/11/13, 17:27 - Jhyan: I can't think of another solution that won't generate complaints
2020/11/13, 17:27 - Jhyan: And detriments
2020/11/13, 17:27 - Adela: unfortunately they don’t have enough funds
2020/11/13, 17:27 - Adela: but mr marais is not teaching us ap
2020/11/13, 17:28 - Adela: meaning we’ll be having ap with ms
chipindu and the rest of the ap class
2020/11/13, 17:28 - Adela: meaning we will be behind
2020/11/13, 17:28 - Jhyan: Did they say that
2020/11/13, 17:28 - Adela: yes
2020/11/13, 17:31 - Jhyan: Wait you said they want to
2020/11/13, 17:31 - Jhyan: Do they want to or are they doing it
2020/11/13, 17:32 - Adela: well as far as i know, ms blanckensee says that is what is happen
2020/11/13, 17:33 - Adela: ap maths classes are merging and ms chipindu is teaching
2020/11/13, 17:33 - Jhyan: But we already knew that
2020/11/13, 17:38 - Adela: yeah but mr marais should be teaching us core maths
2020/11/13, 17:43 - Jhyan: What I'm understanding here is that the extra fees for AP are basically wasted for next year and the last 2 years
2020/11/13, 17:50 - Jhyan: Ok so am I supposed to know about this or are you just telling me
2020/11/13, 17:58 - Adela: i don’t if you are
2020/11/13, 17:58 - Adela: basically
2020/11/13, 17:58 - Jhyan: What does this mean
2020/11/13, 17:59 - Adela: i don’t know if you are* [supposed to know]
2020/11/13, 17:59 - Jhyan: I'm trying to find a field of study that documents levels of information
2020/11/13, 18:01 - Jhyan: Because I _know_ there must be something that explains the theory behind how information can be used relative to how esoteric it is
2020/11/13, 18:02 - Jhyan: Something that relates to law, whistleblowing, PR and social dynamics
2020/11/13, 18:03 - Jhyan: I told my mom about it but I said it might be that we aren't supposed to know so she shouldn't act on it yet
2020/11/13, 18:03 - Jhyan: She said she wants to contact your mom
2020/11/13, 18:03 - Jhyan: Idk if this is weird
2020/11/13, 18:05 - Jhyan: Normally I wouldn't ask but just in case, if it's not weird or if it could be useful can you send her number
2020/11/13, 18:06 - Adela: idk if she should contact my mom about this situation just yet
2020/11/13, 18:06 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/11/13, 18:06 - Adela: but my mom is like a part of the PA
2020/11/13, 18:06 - Adela: so i’ll send her number anyway
2020/11/13, 18:07 - Adela: 083 3094 150
2020/11/13, 18:07 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/11/13, 18:07 - Jhyan: I'll tell my mom this
2020/11/13, 18:07 - Jhyan: Is that the parent group
2020/11/13, 18:09 - Jhyan: Is there a reason besides the fact that the information isn't supposed to be public
2020/11/13, 18:09 - Jhyan: Just tell her I want to check in and get her mom's opinion about the best way to handle this thing
2020/11/13, 18:11 - Adela: no just the marais thing isnt supposed to public yet... like what the way forward is
2020/11/13, 18:11 - Adela: but if she wants to message my mom then like that’s totally fine 😂
2020/11/13, 18:12 - Adela: yeah
2020/11/13, 18:13 - Jhyan: What's your mom's name
2020/11/13, 18:16 - Jhyan: I really don't like how they're controlling the flow of information, especially with the context of how they've done it maliciously in the past
2020/11/13, 18:17 - Jhyan: They've responded to Aidan's personal email and your mom, as well as interrogating Mr Marais. Aidan got a different story to what Mr Marais was told and seemingly what you know now
2020/11/13, 18:18 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/11/13, 18:46 - Jhyan: Thank you for telling me
2020/11/13, 18:46 - Jhyan: The new information
2020/11/14, 16:06 - Jhyan: I've only now recovered from Friday's exams
2020/11/14, 16:06 - Jhyan: They took so much energy
2020/11/14, 17:47 - Jhyan: How are you feeling now after that week?
2020/11/14, 18:54 - Adela: what was the information aidan got?
2020/11/14, 18:55 - Adela: i still have not
2020/11/14, 18:55 - Adela: i just feel kinda dead inside and tired
2020/11/14, 18:55 - Jhyan: Do you really want to talk about it now though
2020/11/14, 18:55 - Adela: sure
2020/11/14, 18:55 - Jhyan: I can relate to that
2020/11/14, 18:58 - Jhyan: Also idk if you saw this
2020/11/14, 18:59 - Jhyan: Ok I'll explain in a bit
2020/11/14, 19:03 - Adela: no problem
2020/11/14, 19:12 - Jhyan: I don't really know the details so take everything with a grain of salt but he told me they said they hadn't decided on it yet, even though this was after Mr Marais was informed that the final decision had been made.

I'm also assuming he made sure he was allowed to tell us because of the fact that he wasn't the first time and almost got in trouble for it. If this is true then I don't see how he could've had the misconception. Either the decision was final and he was told he could tell us or the decision wasn't final and he didn't tell us. But he did.

Anyway so Aidan talked to him about it after he got the response and Marais said Chipindu was the one that told him which further means that either chipindu lied directly to him or that she also had the misconception.
2020/11/14, 19:14 - Jhyan: Idk I might've left out details
2020/11/14, 19:15 - Adela: oh that’s pretty insane. but my mom spoke directly to ms blanckensee though
2020/11/14, 19:15 - Jhyan: Aidan also did
2020/11/14, 19:15 - Jhyan: What's your mom's name btw
2020/11/14, 19:16 - Jhyan: Oh yeah and I forgot to add the fact that she didn't get back to our email or my mom's
2020/11/14, 19:16 - Jhyan: So the selective answering is suspicious to me
2020/11/14, 19:17 - Jhyan: If they had an answer they would've just duplicated that as responses but they're not only being weird about the information but also not responding to some people
2020/11/14, 19:18 - Jhyan: .
2020/11/14, 19:33 - Adela: Faeza Adams
2020/11/14, 19:33 - Adela: i don’t trust this whole situation tbh
2020/11/14, 19:35 - Jhyan: Thanks. It would be awkward to just be like "Greetings [FELLOW PARENT]..." 😂
2020/11/14, 22:35 - Jhyan: Good night. I hope you feel better tomorrow 🤍
2020/11/15, 00:09 - Adela: thank you so much jhyan,
good night
2020/11/15, 00:09 - Adela: 💀💀💀 that would be quite awkward
2020/11/15, 10:08 - Jhyan: Omg I just found this cool thing
2020/11/15, 10:08 - Jhyan: If you search metallic bonding on Google
2020/11/15, 10:08 - Jhyan: Like the app on your phone
2020/11/15, 10:08 - Jhyan: It lets you see a 3D AR model of it
2020/11/15, 10:08 - Jhyan: I knew it did it for animals but this is even better
2020/11/15, 10:12 - Jhyan: Also other bonds but I found the metal one first
2020/11/15, 10:12 - Jhyan: And it looks cool
2020/11/15, 12:56 - Jhyan: There's a circular rainbow around the Sun
2020/11/15, 14:51 - Adela: really?
2020/11/15, 14:51 - Adela: that’s so cool. i’ll do that right now
2020/11/15, 14:52 - Jhyan: Yeah I put pictures on my status
2020/11/15, 14:52 - Jhyan: It might be gone now though
2020/11/15, 14:52 - Adela: that’s so cool
2020/11/15, 14:52 - Adela: i just searched metallic bonding and saw the structure
2020/11/15, 14:53 - Adela: oh i checked those out now
2020/11/15, 14:53 - Jhyan: Isn't it cool seeing it in 3d
2020/11/15, 14:53 - Adela: my phone was not charging so i wasn’t online properly earlier
2020/11/15, 14:54 - Jhyan: There's this VR app that lets you play with molecular structures which was like this also
2020/11/15, 14:54 - Jhyan: This stuff has big potential
2020/11/15, 14:56 - Adela: it really is and the fact that you can move around and see different perspectives
2020/11/15, 14:56 - Adela: oh how great technology is
2020/11/15, 14:58 - Jhyan: How's physics going
2020/11/15, 14:58 - Adela: i don’t know at this point
2020/11/15, 14:58 - Adela: my motivation level is so low
2020/11/15, 14:58 - Jhyan: Eish
2020/11/15, 14:59 - Jhyan: Think about your business degree
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Jhyan: I think about my ultimate goal
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Jhyan: Idk if I'm helping
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Adela: it does help, thank you
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Adela: and the fact that this is the last week also helps
2020/11/15, 15:00 - Jhyan: Yeah I'm way less stressed
2020/11/15, 15:01 - Adela: i’m not writing too many exams this week which helps too
2020/11/15, 15:01 - Adela: only 3 days to go 😭
2020/11/15, 15:01 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/15, 15:02 - Jhyan: I have AP English but at this point I simultaneously don't care and know I can prepare stuff the day before
2020/11/15, 15:08 - Jhyan: One thing I found out during these exams is that caffeine doesn't work on me
2020/11/15, 15:13 - Adela: how does it affect you?
2020/11/15, 15:13 - Adela: i feel you
2020/11/15, 15:13 - Adela: i just need to memorise quotes for english p2
2020/11/15, 15:13 - Adela: i’ve been scratching out things on the timetable
2020/11/15, 15:14 - Jhyan: I never drink coffee because I don't like the taste but sometimes I do "just in case" when I stay up. It never really changed anything and neither did Coke which also has it so I've always suspected it didn't work on me.

I used energy drinks during the exam but they don't change anything either, so this is why I conclusively made the statement that caffeine doesn't work.

I've always been able to get as low as 4 hours of sleep and still function fine the next day so I think it's related to that.
2020/11/15, 15:31 - Jhyan: I considered the possibility that the effect of it was actually extremely weak but there's no way that's true
2020/11/15, 15:31 - Jhyan: Coffee single handedly initiated the age of enlightenment
2020/11/15, 15:32 - Jhyan: Like maybe it was placebo for most people but it's not
2020/11/15, 15:32 - Jhyan: Also the fact that some people are practically addicted to it and that studies have been done that have shown serious effects of it
2020/11/15, 15:33 - Jhyan: Global scientific practice couldn't have collectively made such an error
2020/11/15, 15:33 - Jhyan: So it must be me that is different
2020/11/15, 18:37 - Adela: i guess you’ve never depended on it really
2020/11/15, 18:37 - Adela: i had a caffeine addiction multiple times, but i got myself off that
2020/11/15, 18:38 - Jhyan: Yeah I've never been able to be dependant on it
2020/11/15, 18:38 - Adela: yeah i have seen addicts, i have been one myself and my dad is a hectic one. he can only function if he has 3 espresso shots a day
2020/11/15, 18:38 - Jhyan: Like if some guy didn't get any reaction from cocaine he would be immune to a cocaine addiction
2020/11/15, 18:39 - Adela: this is true
2020/11/15, 18:39 - Adela: or any drug in that case
2020/11/15, 18:39 - Jhyan: Yeah my mom also
2020/11/15, 18:40 - Jhyan: She burns through so many packets of coffee
2020/11/15, 18:42 - Adela: i got a caffeine addiction when i went to spain because it was the most accessible drink which wasn’t water
2020/11/15, 18:42 - Adela: then i came back to johannesburg and i could barely function
2020/11/15, 18:43 - Adela: but i didn’t want to have a caffeine addiction so i just cut myself off from caffeine
2020/11/15, 18:43 - Jhyan: I have no way of imagining what that's like
2020/11/15, 18:43 - Jhyan: I remember you were really cold in Spain
2020/11/15, 18:50 - Adela: yeah i was mainly cold in london yoh
2020/11/15, 18:50 - Jhyan: London
2020/11/15, 18:51 - Jhyan: My uncle associates christmas with summer so he was weirded out when it was snowy and cold in europe during christmas when he was studying there
2020/11/15, 19:33 - Adela: yeah when i went to spain, i went to london too
2020/11/15, 19:33 - Adela: yeah it is quite weird to experience. i still want to have a white christmas though
2020/11/15, 19:34 - Jhyan: I just did the past paper and realised I'm not ready for the exam
2020/11/15, 19:34 - Jhyan: I made so many mistakes
2020/11/15, 19:35 - Adela: i don’t know how to be ready for physics
2020/11/15, 19:35 - Adela: but don’t beat yourself up about not doing well in the past paper
2020/11/15, 19:35 - Jhyan: I did fast though
2020/11/15, 19:35 - Adela: otherwise you’ll keep that unsure attitude in the exam
2020/11/15, 19:35 - Jhyan: But what am I supposed to do now
2020/11/15, 19:38 - Adela: just try and practise
go over where you struggled and solidify those concepts
2020/11/15, 19:38 - Adela: but don’t beat yourself up
2020/11/15, 20:27 - Jhyan: Do you think everyone is doing worse this term
2020/11/15, 20:34 - Adela: i do honestly
2020/11/15, 20:34 - Adela: in shc
2020/11/15, 20:34 - Jhyan: That's a blessing and a curse
2020/11/15, 20:35 - Jhyan: Wait no
2020/11/15, 20:35 - Jhyan: It's just a blessing
2020/11/15, 20:35 - Jhyan: Lmao
2020/11/15, 21:33 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/15, 21:33 - Jhyan: I'm stupid
2020/11/15, 21:33 - Jhyan: It's back to being this
2020/11/15, 21:38 - Jhyan: Anyway I did another past paper and it was ok
2020/11/15, 22:09 - Adela: oh that’s great
2020/11/15, 22:09 - Adela: i looked over the matric past paper
2020/11/15, 22:09 - Jhyan: And
2020/11/15, 22:18 - Jhyan: Also I know chemistry well and that isn't in the past paper
2020/11/15, 22:18 - Jhyan: So not only will I get good marks for that but I will generate extra time from that too
2020/11/15, 22:19 - Adela: yeah it isn’t
2020/11/15, 22:19 - Adela: because chemistry is paper 2
2020/11/15, 22:19 - Jhyan: Yeah and our paper is combined
2020/11/15, 22:19 - Jhyan: Thanks for the advice earlier
2020/11/15, 22:23 - Adela: oh your welcome
2020/11/15, 23:15 - Jhyan: I hope we both do well tomorrow
2020/11/15, 23:15 - Jhyan: Good night Adela 🌙
2020/11/15, 23:31 - Adela: good night jhyab
2020/11/15, 23:31 - Adela: jhyan*
2020/11/15, 23:31 - Adela: ❤️
2020/11/16, 14:44 - Jhyan: You were done in like 14 minutes
2020/11/16, 14:46 - Adela: because i didn’t really try 😭
2020/11/16, 14:46 - Jhyan: Did you at least guess answers
2020/11/16, 14:50 - Adela: yhup that’s exactly what i did
2020/11/16, 15:05 - Jhyan: If you guessed at random your mark has a binomial probability distribution
2020/11/16, 21:37 - Jhyan: Is your headache better
2020/11/16, 22:20 - Adela: barely but i feel like it will be better after i sleep tonight
2020/11/16, 22:20 - Adela: thank you so much for checking in though
2020/11/17, 14:55 - Jhyan: One more exam left
2020/11/17, 17:31 - Jhyan: Do you know how to prove a parallelogram
2020/11/17, 17:31 - Jhyan: There were like 3 ways but they're not in the textbook
2020/11/17, 17:31 - Jhyan: And I think we only learned them last year
2020/11/18, 08:00 - Jhyan: Oh they are in the textbook
2020/11/18, 08:32 - Adela: sorry for not getting back to you, i wasn’t really studying last night🥴
2020/11/18, 08:32 - Jhyan: I get you
2020/11/18, 08:33 - Jhyan: I could only manage to do analytical geometry and then I gave up
2020/11/18, 08:34 - Adela: i’m going to study today eish
2020/11/18, 08:34 - Jhyan: Well I hope you don't get another headache
2020/11/18, 08:35 - Adela: i really hope so too
because that was a really painful 36 hours
2020/11/18, 12:42 - Jhyan: You know up until 1934 mathematics was considered a creative art
2020/11/18, 12:42 - Jhyan: Or at least a creative subject
2020/11/18, 12:49 - Adela: i don’t see it at all
2020/11/18, 12:50 - Jhyan: Mathematicians would invent new ways of manipulating and describing numbers
2020/11/18, 12:50 - Jhyan: There weren't as many foundations as there are now
2020/11/18, 12:50 - Jhyan: You could practically do whatever you wanted in maths
2020/11/18, 12:51 - Adela: that would be fun actually
2020/11/18, 12:52 - Jhyan: Actually it links into the question of whether we're discovering or inventing new maths
2020/11/18, 12:53 - Jhyan: It's happened multiple times even we've invented theoretical concepts and found out they describe the universe afterwards
2020/11/18, 12:54 - Jhyan: *when
2020/11/18, 18:40 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 18:40 - Jhyan: This is the equation for a circle where the centre isn't at the origin right
2020/11/18, 18:40 - Jhyan: So let's say the equation is (x-5)²+(y+1)²=4 right
2020/11/18, 18:40 - Jhyan: The centre should be (5;-1)
2020/11/18, 18:40 - Jhyan: If you input the centre values of x and y into the equation it will give you 0=4
2020/11/18, 18:41 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 18:41 - Jhyan: Which is obviously wrong so do we just ignore it or
2020/11/18, 18:41 - Jhyan: I don't know if I'm missing something
2020/11/18, 18:45 - Adela: yeah i think it’s supposed to be like that for some reason
2020/11/18, 18:45 - Jhyan: Oh I'm an idiot
2020/11/18, 18:45 - Jhyan: I just realised
2020/11/18, 18:45 - Jhyan: It's not on the circumference
2020/11/18, 18:45 - Adela: the centre should be this
2020/11/18, 18:46 - Jhyan: Which is what the equation describes
2020/11/18, 18:46 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/18, 18:46 - Jhyan: Thanks
2020/11/18, 18:46 - Adela: yeah exactly like that
2020/11/18, 18:46 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense
2020/11/18, 18:47 - Adela: but it should be the midpoint of the diameter if that a diameter is shown
2020/11/18, 18:47 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/18, 18:47 - Adela: if the diameter is given*
2020/11/18, 18:47 - Jhyan: I'm just doing the past paper
2020/11/18, 18:48 - Adela: oh yes that past paper
2020/11/18, 18:48 - Adela: paper 2 is so much harder than paper 1
2020/11/18, 18:48 - Jhyan: Yeah I agree
2020/11/18, 18:48 - Jhyan: Although I'm still doing well on time somehow
2020/11/18, 18:49 - Jhyan: I did a huge amount of Euclidean questions last term so it's probably paying off now
2020/11/18, 20:35 - Jhyan: It's probably because Mr Marais always sets it
2020/11/18, 20:36 - Adela: mr marais sets such difficult papers
2020/11/18, 20:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/18, 20:36 - Jhyan: He would say he sets "fun" papers
2020/11/18, 20:44 - Adela: this is true
2020/11/18, 20:44 - Adela: he gets excited at difficult problems
2020/11/18, 20:44 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/11/18, 20:46 - Jhyan: Student: "Sir I found this impossible maths conjecture onli-"

Mr Marais:

2020/11/18, 20:46 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 20:46 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:10 - Jhyan: Are you still studying?
2020/11/18, 21:16 - Adela: yeah it’s on and off really
2020/11/18, 21:16 - Adela: this is so true 😭😭
2020/11/18, 21:16 - Jhyan: Have you done the past paper
2020/11/18, 21:16 - Jhyan: There's only 2 questions I can't figure out
2020/11/18, 21:17 - Adela: yes i have
2020/11/18, 21:17 - Adela: which ones?
2020/11/18, 21:17 - Jhyan: 12.2 (d)
2020/11/18, 21:17 - Jhyan: And 9.3
2020/11/18, 21:22 - Adela: lemme see what i did
2020/11/18, 21:22 - Adela: i didn’t do all questions
2020/11/18, 21:23 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Adela: so i didn’t do 12
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Adela: but for 9.3, the memo pretty much explains the concept and i also didn’t get it by myself
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I forgot the memo exists
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Jhyan: Lmao
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Adela: but like basically the diameter is given so then the perpendicular bisector is created which will pass through the centres of the circles
2020/11/18, 21:28 - Adela: i live with the memo 😭
2020/11/18, 21:29 - Adela: and then diameter and this bisector are made to equal one another so that the centre can be determined because it will be where these two lines meet
2020/11/18, 21:29 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I understand that
2020/11/18, 21:30 - Jhyan: I wouldn't have thought of it though
2020/11/18, 21:30 - Jhyan: Also the scope refers to notes he posted on circles for analytical geometry but they don't exist
2020/11/18, 21:38 - Jhyan: Ok I think I'm ready
2020/11/18, 21:53 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:53 - Adela: i also wouldn’t have
2020/11/18, 21:53 - Adela: theyre like from march or something
2020/11/18, 21:54 - Jhyan: But I went through every single lesson on analytical geometry
2020/11/18, 21:55 - Jhyan: To me it looks like you have to multiply the RHS by the numerator's conjugate
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: these notes
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: they were posted in april
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Jhyan: And then you'll have 1-cos²ø somewhere which can be equated to sin²ø
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Jhyan: And stuff
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Adela: i’ll try that
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Jhyan: Just do it you'll see
2020/11/18, 21:56 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/18, 21:57 - Jhyan: Yeah that's why. He posted them the month after we finished analytical geometry
2020/11/18, 21:58 - Adela: i tried all of this and it worked
thank you so much
2020/11/18, 21:58 - Adela: i didn’t think about conjugates at all
2020/11/18, 21:58 - Adela: makes sense
2020/11/18, 21:58 - Adela: he did it closer to when we were doing trig
2020/11/18, 21:58 - Jhyan: You're welcome
2020/11/18, 22:15 - Jhyan: Good luck for tomorrow
 🌙
2020/11/18, 22:18 - Adela: you too jhyan 🕊
2020/11/19, 12:12 - Jhyan: You're finished now right?
2020/11/19, 12:12 - Jhyan: 🥂
2020/11/19, 13:03 - Jhyan: Well you can ignore these then
2020/11/19, 13:03 - Jhyan: I didn't think I'd get to talk to you at school
2020/11/19, 14:37 - Adela: oh lol 😭
2020/11/19, 14:37 - Adela: you have one more to go
2020/11/19, 14:37 - Adela: ap english
2020/11/19, 14:52 - Jhyan: Oh I misread this and thought it said "I have one more to go"
2020/11/19, 14:52 - Jhyan: Yeah but I don't really care about AP
2020/11/19, 14:56 - Jhyan: I'll prepare for it tomorrow
2020/11/19, 14:58 - Adela: no my holiday basically starts today
2020/11/19, 15:08 - Jhyan: What's your favourite food
2020/11/19, 15:10 - Adela: i really like cheesy pastas
2020/11/19, 15:11 - Jhyan: And spaghetti at the tuck shop is the closest to that
2020/11/19, 15:15 - Adela: pretty much 😂😂😂
2020/11/19, 15:16 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/19, 15:16 - Jhyan: Don't ask me why I made that in Photoshop
2020/11/19, 15:22 - Adela: 💀💀💀💀
2020/11/20, 17:11 - Jhyan: Do you want to go next weekend
2020/11/20, 17:11 - Jhyan: I've only been to the Exclusive Books in Rosebank once. Do you want to go there?
2020/11/21, 00:36 - Adela: i’m not sure whether i’ll be able to next weekend 🥴
tanya wants me to come to this photo shoot for like a magazine feature of this one organisation we’re a part of on saturday and then on sunday i’m going hiking 😭
2020/11/21, 00:36 - Adela: but the rosebank exclusive books is really really nice
2020/11/21, 06:44 - Jhyan: When are you free then
2020/11/21, 12:11 - Jhyan: I'm officially done with exams now
2020/11/21, 12:16 - Jhyan: I was suggesting that it was a positive that I hadn't been there because it will be new
2020/11/21, 22:12 - Adela: i’m so happy for you 🥺
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Adela: i’m not sure, but i’ll let you know
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Adela: you’ve never been there?
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Jhyan: I've been there once
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Jhyan: To look for a textbook briefly
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Jhyan: I usually go to Eastgate or Bedford
2020/11/21, 22:13 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/11/21, 22:14 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/11/21, 22:14 - Jhyan: 🧊
2020/11/22, 00:06 - Jhyan: Don't forget these. I actually think you'll enjoy them.
2020/11/22, 05:29 - Jhyan: I just had another inception dream but it wasn't as fleshed out as the earphone one where my brain tricked me
2020/11/22, 05:29 - Jhyan: But you were in it
2020/11/22, 05:32 - Jhyan: We were in business studies at the start of next year and I was sitting next to you and then I fell asleep. But as I was waking up to real life I was confused for a moment about which reality was real and thought I might wake up next to you for a second.
2020/11/23, 23:26 - Jhyan: If that message was weird I apologize because it wasn't meant to be
2020/11/23, 23:46 - Adela: oh i’ve had a couple of those dreams where it’s like a dream within a dream
2020/11/23, 23:46 - Adela: sorry for not responding earlier, i told myself to respond before and enter the message but i forgot about the relo cat and i was preoccupied with that for a while this week
2020/11/23, 23:47 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2020/11/23, 23:47 - Jhyan: Does the relo thing take a long time
2020/11/24, 00:16 - Adela: for me, it has honestly 😭
2020/11/24, 00:16 - Jhyan: I haven't started it yet
2020/11/24, 00:16 - Adela: so you’re going to have to push to do the slideshow and the speech for wed?
2020/11/24, 00:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/24, 00:17 - Jhyan: Wait there's a speech
2020/11/24, 00:17 - Adela: yeah there is
2020/11/24, 00:18 - Jhyan: How
2020/11/24, 00:20 - Jhyan: Isn't it just a bunch of questions and a slideshow
2020/11/24, 00:20 - Jhyan: I too he said we didn't have to do the last part or something
2020/11/24, 00:24 - Jhyan: *thought
2020/11/24, 00:27 - Adela: you don’t have to do a whole documentary, but you have to have some oral presentation
2020/11/24, 00:27 - Adela: the way i understood it
2020/11/24, 00:28 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/24, 00:28 - Jhyan: I looked through the book and I can do it in a day
2020/11/24, 00:29 - Jhyan: Do we do all 4 questions
2020/11/24, 00:29 - Jhyan: Or 3 or whatever it was
2020/11/24, 00:37 - Adela: you just have to do the end where it mentions a slideshow and stuff
2020/11/24, 00:38 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2020/11/24, 00:38 - Jhyan: That's easy then
2020/11/24, 00:38 - Adela: things are out of a lot of marks, for me it was just a lot of research and stuff
2020/11/24, 00:39 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/11/25, 13:58 - Jhyan: So what have you been doing besides the RELO project
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Jhyan: Now that you have free time
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Adela: funny story but i actually lost my whole relo assignment last night
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Adela: so had to restart
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Jhyan: What
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Jhyan: How
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Jhyan: That's insane
2020/11/25, 13:59 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/25, 14:00 - Adela: yeah it was on keynote and i cleared my icloud to make space to save the videos i needed to edit for the speech part
2020/11/25, 14:00 - Adela: turns out the keynote was in the icloud
2020/11/25, 14:00 - Jhyan: 😬😬😬
2020/11/25, 14:00 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/25, 14:01 - Jhyan: Did you manage to read again with the "free time" you thought you would have lmao
2020/11/25, 14:02 - Adela: i havent had free time since
2020/11/25, 14:02 - Jhyan: Yeah I realised
2020/11/25, 14:02 - Jhyan: So I turned the message info a joke
2020/11/25, 14:02 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/11/25, 14:03 - Jhyan: *into
2020/11/25, 14:03 - Adela: yeah i figured 😂😂😂
2020/11/25, 14:03 - Adela: but now i officially have free time
2020/11/25, 14:03 - Jhyan: So your exams are actually over now
2020/11/25, 14:04 - Adela: pretty much
2020/11/25, 14:04 - Jhyan: I got my braces off on Monday
2020/11/25, 14:13 - Adela: wow... how long have you had them for?
2020/11/25, 14:40 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/25, 14:40 - Jhyan: Like 3 years
2020/11/25, 14:40 - Jhyan: Or 2
2020/11/25, 14:43 - Jhyan: It's this other humanoid thing from an anime but basically just the fact that the teeth are large and exposed
2020/11/25, 14:53 - Adela: yoh that’s a long time, it must feel like a relief to have them out
2020/11/25, 14:53 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2020/11/25, 14:54 - Jhyan: Yeah it's pretty good
2020/11/25, 14:54 - Jhyan: My teeth feel smooth
2020/11/25, 15:04 - Jhyan: But I'm supposed to wear this retainer now
2020/11/25, 16:22 - Adela: oh yes i know abt that
2020/11/25, 16:22 - Adela: it must yoh
2020/11/25, 18:07 - Jhyan: Are you annoyec that you did a whole video and I just came in like
2020/11/25, 18:07 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/25, 18:21 - Adela: idk how the marks are going to be gotten
2020/11/25, 18:21 - Adela: because he did ask for a video
2020/11/26, 00:38 - Jhyan: What would you think of a program that analyses your WhatsApp conversations and learns to become a placeholder for you
2020/11/26, 00:38 - Jhyan: Not you specifically
2020/11/26, 00:39 - Jhyan: Like a user would import their chat data and it would be analysed and a model would be created that responds like the user would.
2020/11/27, 02:53 - Jhyan: I started learning AI again and actually trained a model this time to recognise handwritten numbers in 28x28px images
2020/11/27, 02:56 - Jhyan: Btw did you find a time when you're free
2020/11/30, 13:18 - Jhyan: You know that email they were supposed to send
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Jhyan: Did you get it
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Jhyan: For the awards
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Adela: no i didn’t
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Jhyan: I didn't either
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Adela: i wouldn’t be that comfortable i guess because at the end of the day, i won’t be able to speak to a person
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Jhyan: Idk if I just didn't get an award or if they're delayed
2020/11/30, 13:19 - Adela: that’s really really cool, jhyan
2020/11/30, 13:20 - Adela: unfortunately i’ve been kinda busy. like this weekend wasn’t a good time and this week i have another hike
2020/11/30, 13:20 - Adela: i think it’s delayed
2020/11/30, 13:20 - Jhyan: Hopefully
2020/11/30, 13:39 - Jhyan: I might have to leave somewhere in December but I don't know when. I've been trying to find out so I can let you know because it would be a hard limit on the time I have available.
2020/11/30, 14:11 - Adela: im going to cape town on the 11th
2020/11/30, 14:11 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/30, 14:11 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/11/30, 14:12 - Jhyan: The earliest I thought I would possibly leave was the 10th
2020/11/30, 15:18 - Jhyan: Theoretically we can go on a week day right
2020/11/30, 16:46 - Jhyan: Do you often go hiking?
2020/11/30, 19:14 - Jhyan: Oh yeah also I asked and apparently they're sending the invites tomorrow
2020/11/30, 19:15 - Jhyan: For the awards ceremony
2020/11/30, 19:52 - Adela: yeah that’s what my mom told me too
2020/11/30, 21:56 - Jhyan: Do you have any free before the 11th
2020/12/01, 01:03 - Adela: not too often, tanya kinda got me into it
2020/12/01, 01:04 - Adela: well i have my learners booked for the 10th which i’m quite excited about, the weekend may not be a good time for me too
2020/12/01, 08:10 - Jhyan: Well what about the three days before the 10th
2020/12/01, 08:12 - Jhyan: Otherwise we can just wait until we're back
2020/12/01, 08:13 - Jhyan: Also I might be in Cape Town later coincidentally but I have incomplete data on how viable an option like that is
2020/12/02, 19:02 - Jhyan: Well done 🥂🥂
2020/12/02, 19:03 - Jhyan: Only you could have your mind go blank in the exam and still get a distinction in AP maths
2020/12/02, 20:08 - Adela: well done to you too ❤️
2020/12/02, 20:08 - Adela: i don’t even know how that happened
2020/12/03, 11:07 - Jhyan: Have you ever heard of H. P. Lovecraft?
2020/12/03, 11:08 - Jhyan: He basically invented his own literary genre
2020/12/03, 11:09 - Jhyan: You've almost definitely seen his legacy in other things, but his original stories are the highest concentration of that style
2020/12/03, 11:12 - Jhyan: The most adapted concept was of Cthulhu, from The Call of Cthulhu
2020/12/04, 08:55 - Jhyan: Please still fight the decision about Chipindu teaching AP
2020/12/04, 08:55 - Jhyan: If you still can
2020/12/04, 08:55 - Jhyan: A number of us are still fighting it
2020/12/04, 11:27 - Jhyan: Let's delay it until you get back. Does that work for you?
2020/12/04, 11:38 - Adela: that does work for me
2020/12/04, 11:38 - Adela: i havent actually
2020/12/04, 11:38 - Jhyan: Great
2020/12/04, 11:39 - Adela: sorry for being really bad at responding, some of my friends were robbed and i’ve just been all over the place
2020/12/04, 11:39 - Jhyan: That's totally justified in a situation like that
2020/12/04, 11:39 - Jhyan: Thank you for letting me know
2020/12/04, 11:41 - Jhyan: I hope everyone involved is okay and everything
2020/12/04, 11:48 - Adela: thanks jhyan. everyone is physically fine, emotionally and mentally is a different story
2020/12/04, 11:48 - Adela: for me it just triggered some old trauma of mine
2020/12/04, 11:48 - Jhyan: I can imagine
2020/12/04, 12:01 - Jhyan: None of the possible responses I can say feel genuine over text
2020/12/05, 00:31 - Jhyan: I asked you about it before, and I still didn't find the meaning of it
2020/12/05, 00:32 - Jhyan: But the general use of ⊕ is interesting
2020/12/05, 00:32 - Jhyan: It's like a variable for operations; the exact operation it refers to can be assigned
2020/12/05, 00:33 - Jhyan: Anyway I just found it interesting
2020/12/05, 00:55 - Jhyan: Good night
2020/12/05, 00:56 - Adela: like even division and multiplication?
2020/12/05, 00:56 - Adela: goodnight jhyan ❤️
2020/12/05, 00:56 - Jhyan: I think you technically can but nobody would
2020/12/05, 09:47 - Jhyan: I saw it uses as a XOR gate operation
2020/12/05, 09:48 - Jhyan: If either one or the other out of two inputs is 1, it outputs 1, but not if both are 1
2020/12/05, 09:48 - Jhyan: Otherwise 0
2020/12/05, 09:48 - Jhyan: It's a circuitry logic gate
2020/12/05, 09:49 - Jhyan: So it was like a ⊕ b = c
2020/12/07, 18:00 - Jhyan: Do you think we'll need HP smart ever again
2020/12/07, 18:21 - Adela: i’m guessing we’d need to scan documents again at some point
2020/12/07, 18:23 - Jhyan: I'm trying to find apps that I can uninstall
2020/12/08, 21:53 - Jhyan: Is there a story behind keeping your about the same for more than 2 years
2020/12/09, 12:47 - Adela: not really, i just never got around to changing it and i’m sentimental in weird ways
2020/12/09, 12:47 - Adela: i kinda like the fact that it’s been consistent for so long
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Jhyan: I kept my profile pic the same for that reason
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Adela: oh i see
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Adela: my profile picture constantly changes on the other hand
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Adela: i’m at home studying today, i feel like i’m back in exams
2020/12/09, 12:48 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/09, 12:49 - Jhyan: My current about is from that movie I told you about
2020/12/09, 12:49 - Jhyan: Your Name
2020/12/09, 12:49 - Adela: oh i see, it’s a quote
2020/12/09, 12:49 - Jhyan: You're doing your learner's tomorrow right
2020/12/09, 12:49 - Adela: yeah i am 🥴
2020/12/09, 12:50 - Jhyan: And then leaving on Friday
2020/12/09, 12:50 - Jhyan: I would say good luck, but between the reports easiness of the test and your competence, you don't need it
2020/12/09, 17:22 - Jhyan: *reported
2020/12/09, 18:29 - Adela: it’s actually not too easy, people make it seem like a walk in the park but you need quite a high mark to pass
2020/12/09, 18:29 - Adela: but thank you nonetheless
2020/12/09, 18:29 - Adela: indeed
2020/12/09, 18:32 - Jhyan: Yeah all I know is that you need to know what signs mean lmao
2020/12/09, 19:45 - Adela: you need to controls of a vehicle, rules of the road and then signs
2020/12/09, 19:45 - Adela: rules of the road and signs are like the hardest bits
2020/12/09, 19:45 - Jhyan: I would think the signs are the easiest
2020/12/09, 19:46 - Jhyan: I feel like I'd be able to memorize those quickly
2020/12/09, 19:46 - Jhyan: Rules would be harder depending on how it's tested
2020/12/09, 19:46 - Jhyan: Do the make you write out scenarios or justifications or something
2020/12/09, 19:46 - Adela: nah but they dont ask what signs means normally like those are the easy questions, they ask about actions following the signs and the questions are like meant to trick you
2020/12/09, 19:46 - Adela: it’s multiple choice
2020/12/09, 19:47 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/12/09, 19:47 - Jhyan: They're meant to trick you?
2020/12/09, 19:48 - Adela: like mislead you because a lot of the answers appear to be the same
2020/12/09, 19:48 - Jhyan: Is it time limited
2020/12/09, 19:48 - Jhyan: If it is, is it something you have to worry about
2020/12/09, 19:49 - Adela: yeah it is
2020/12/09, 19:49 - Adela: there are 68 questions
2020/12/09, 19:49 - Adela: and you have 68 minutes
2020/12/09, 19:49 - Adela: it’s kinda impossible not the finish within the time
2020/12/09, 19:49 - Jhyan: One minute per question sounds like a little though
2020/12/09, 19:50 - Adela: nah but the questions don’t require working out or anything
2020/12/09, 19:50 - Adela: and it’s multiple choice
2020/12/09, 19:50 - Jhyan: I guess
2020/12/09, 19:51 - Jhyan: But I would waste time trying to rationalize the differences between the meaning in the sentences judging by this
2020/12/09, 19:52 - Jhyan: I always do that passively
2020/12/09, 19:54 - Jhyan: Sometimes I'm just doing random stuff and I realise there's an internal monologue theorising the origin of a word based on its root word or finding the meaning to certain common root words from languages that predate English
2020/12/09, 19:54 - Jhyan: Anyway I guess you're probably preparing
2020/12/09, 20:38 - Adela: i’ve been doing practice tests yeah
2020/12/09, 20:38 - Adela: that sounds really hectic
2020/12/09, 20:39 - Jhyan: I'll try catch it the next time it happens because I can't think of a good example
2020/12/09, 20:39 - Jhyan: But it's strangely therapeutic to think about
2020/12/09, 21:23 - Adela: yeah please do
2020/12/10, 00:40 - Jhyan: Good night
2020/12/10, 12:57 - Jhyan: It's not an example but it's related; when I'm in the flow state I start repeating words that my brain found interesting subconsciously. It's like having a song earworm but for words. My current theory is that I'm doing it all the time but it's not "loud" enough to hear and only when I'm focusing so hard in flow state that there isn't an actual train of thought I can "hear" it.

One time it was with the word "socioeconomic", where it just kept getting repeated in my head while I was painting.
2020/12/10, 23:15 - Jhyan: Oh I just thought of as example
2020/12/10, 23:15 - Jhyan: The word chemistry
2020/12/10, 23:15 - Jhyan: I linked in to alchemy and started thinking about the "Chem" part
2020/12/10, 23:16 - Jhyan: Like
 alchemy > alchemical> ~al~chemical > chemical
2020/12/10, 23:16 - Jhyan: The \~al~ is supposed to be ~al~
2020/12/10, 23:17 - Jhyan: And then I'd wonder about the timeline of it and what "chem" means and where it comes from exactly
2020/12/10, 23:17 - Jhyan: But just passively
2020/12/10, 23:21 - Jhyan: And also about the "istry" part and try to find patterns for what rules end in that by identifying other words or ministry and forestry
2020/12/10, 23:22 - Jhyan: It's can be an endless chain if you keep finding oddities and try to analyse them
2020/12/11, 10:19 - Adela: i feel like i do this too, my mind is always busy and i always have like words in my head that go on and on
2020/12/11, 10:20 - Adela: that’s quite a lot of thinking you do.
geez, your mind must be so busy
2020/12/11, 10:20 - Adela: yeah it really can. words are really complicated when you think about them too much
2020/12/11, 10:20 - Adela: oh btw, i got my learners license
2020/12/11, 10:37 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/12/11, 10:38 - Jhyan: Have you ever been in the flow state? I would be interested to know what happens when you're in it
2020/12/12, 09:42 - Jhyan: Also can we please set an actual date for the book shop thing because I don't want it to get delayed by circumstance again
2020/12/14, 17:22 - Jhyan: Does your hair ever get stuck in your eyebrows
2020/12/14, 17:22 - Jhyan: Like Velcro but on a much weaker scale
2020/12/14, 18:53 - Adela: no that’s never happened to me 😂
2020/12/14, 18:54 - Adela: i don’t think i have actually
2020/12/14, 18:54 - Jhyan: It happens to me
2020/12/14, 18:55 - Jhyan: It's a pretty unique experience
2020/12/14, 18:56 - Jhyan: Idk how to explain it
2020/12/14, 18:56 - Jhyan: Are you having fun in Cape Town
2020/12/14, 19:02 - Adela: i’m really enjoying it
2020/12/14, 19:02 - Adela: i can’t wait to move here
2020/12/14, 19:02 - Jhyan: You're gonna move there
2020/12/14, 19:02 - Jhyan: ?
2020/12/14, 23:16 - Jhyan: I've only been to Cape Town once
2020/12/15, 00:50 - Adela: yeah, after matric
2020/12/15, 00:51 - Adela: thats so weird to think about because i basically grew up here
2020/12/15, 23:18 - Jhyan: So is it that you don't like Joburg or do you just prefer Cape Town
2020/12/15, 23:18 - Jhyan: Do you have nostalgia from this
2020/12/16, 00:24 - Adela: yeah not really
2020/12/16, 00:24 - Adela: i just want to experience the cpt student life
2020/12/16, 09:20 - Jhyan: I feel like this happened days ago
2020/12/16, 09:25 - Jhyan: Like as in I woke up and opened the chat having remembered seeing seeing this days ago and was super surprised when it was literally this morning
2020/12/16, 09:26 - Jhyan: I don't even remember reading those messages and I put my phone down at 23:33 but I know I did because I've read them before
2020/12/16, 09:26 - Jhyan: Either my dreams were seemingly days long or my brain was too tired to record the memory properly or something
2020/12/16, 09:29 - Jhyan: Or maybe 2020 just messed up my perception of time, I've noticed other things happen since school ended
2020/12/16, 09:29 - Jhyan: So you decided to go to UCT
2020/12/16, 12:35 - Adela: yeah i am
2020/12/16, 12:36 - Adela: i think 2020 messed with a lot of things
2020/12/16, 12:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/16, 12:36 - Jhyan: I remember grade 10 more than grade 11
2020/12/16, 14:40 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/12/16, 14:41 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/12/16, 14:45 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/12/16, 14:45 - Jhyan: What do you think of this
2020/12/16, 14:46 - Jhyan: WhatsApp suppresses the audio or something and messes it up
2020/12/16, 14:46 - Jhyan: Like if I use the vn function
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Adela: yeah whatsapp doesn’t take the best recordings
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Adela: this is so beautiful 😭
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Adela: honestly so so beautiful
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Adela: is this you playing?
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Jhyan: I didn't compose it though
2020/12/16, 18:20 - Jhyan: It's one of the songs from the soundtrack of Death Note
2020/12/16, 18:21 - Adela: death note? the movie you told me abt?
2020/12/16, 18:21 - Jhyan: No it's a series
2020/12/16, 18:21 - Jhyan: An anime
2020/12/16, 18:22 - Jhyan: I doubt you'll watch it but it's one of the best things I've ever watched
2020/12/16, 18:22 - Jhyan: It's tragic and ironic
2020/12/16, 18:22 - Jhyan: The world felt real
2020/12/16, 18:23 - Jhyan: I can play more but I pause when I transition to other parts of it
2020/12/16, 18:26 - Jhyan: It's about a notebook that kills people when their names are written in it, and the intertwined rivalry of two geniuses: the guy who found it and a detective that's trying to find it. The narrative is perfectly balanced to give you anxiety.
2020/12/16, 18:27 - Jhyan: Idk how to explain it
2020/12/16, 18:42 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/12/16, 18:42 - Jhyan: That's a later part of it
2020/12/16, 18:45 - Jhyan: The movie I told you about is called Your Name (or the other one was A Silent Voice) if you were still planning on watching it.
2020/12/16, 18:45 - Jhyan: Or idk if you just wanted to know
2020/12/16, 18:50 - Jhyan: It's actually not the first song from Death Note I started learning but it's easier than the other one
2020/12/16, 18:53 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/12/16, 18:53 - Jhyan: This is the other one
2020/12/16, 18:53 - Jhyan: Oh the first theme is called Misa's Theme B and this one is called Low of Solipsism
2020/12/16, 18:54 - Jhyan: It's harder so I'm worse at it 😬😂
2020/12/16, 19:03 - Jhyan: Ok I've sent like a whole array of messages so sorry about that
2020/12/17, 00:28 - Adela: i can’t really listen to this rn, i’ll try to listen tomorrow
2020/12/17, 00:28 - Adela: oh i see
2020/12/17, 00:29 - Adela: i’m sure you’re good
2020/12/17, 00:29 - Jhyan: That's cool
2020/12/17, 00:29 - Adela: piano is my favourite thing to listen to so i look forward to listening later
2020/12/17, 00:29 - Jhyan: Well I was able to play it competently at one point but that was months ago
2020/12/17, 00:30 - Jhyan: That's interesting to know
2020/12/17, 00:30 - Jhyan: What are you doing rn
2020/12/17, 18:29 - Jhyan: I played almost the whole song
2020/12/17, 22:03 - Adela: i’ve just been in cape town, i went to uct and then the promenade today
2020/12/17, 22:03 - Adela: this is so lovely, jhyan wow
2020/12/17, 22:03 - Adela: i can hear that’s a continuation
2020/12/17, 22:04 - Adela: this sounds entirely different in terms of the whole mood
2020/12/17, 22:04 - Jhyan: Thank you
2020/12/17, 22:04 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2020/12/17, 22:04 - Jhyan: I actually almost went to a UCT open day back in March
2020/12/17, 22:04 - Jhyan: My uncle moved to Cape Town for some nature conservation job
2020/12/17, 22:08 - Jhyan: Like it's actually helpful I really appreciate it
2020/12/18, 01:35 - Adela: you’re really so welcome
2020/12/18, 01:36 - Adela: where are you thinking of studying?
2020/12/18, 08:06 - Jhyan: I was thinking either UCT or wits
2020/12/18, 08:06 - Jhyan: But originally I wanted to go overseas
2020/12/18, 08:07 - Jhyan: The only thing that stopped me was that bachelor's degrees aren't in English in EU countries where it would be free for my to study because I'm an EU citizen
2020/12/18, 08:07 - Jhyan: My grandfather is Dutch so I got a Dutch passport
2020/12/18, 08:08 - Jhyan: Anyway maybe I will still try English speaking universities
2020/12/18, 08:09 - Jhyan: Also actuarial science is apparently shorter here than other places so it might be a shortcut
2020/12/18, 11:16 - Adela: wait you wanna do actuarial science too?
2020/12/18, 11:17 - Jhyan: Yeah...
2020/12/18, 11:17 - Jhyan: I thought you were gonna go into business
2020/12/18, 11:18 - Jhyan: Well I guess it is business
2020/12/18, 11:18 - Adela: i’m doing business science specialising in actuarial science
2020/12/18, 11:18 - Jhyan: But I thought of it more as mathematics
2020/12/18, 11:18 - Jhyan: That's crazy
2020/12/18, 11:21 - Jhyan: I decided on it a while ago
2020/12/18, 11:23 - Jhyan: Yeah idk that's really cool
2020/12/18, 11:44 - Jhyan: Before that I was considering being a physicist or software engineer but there's a significant pay difference
2020/12/18, 11:48 - Jhyan: Actually it's not the final career path I had in mind. Being an actuary is a backup for what I actually want to do
2020/12/18, 11:49 - Jhyan: But it's too ambitious for most people to accept so I don't tell anyone
2020/12/18, 11:52 - Adela: what is it that you actually want to do
2020/12/18, 11:55 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/12/18, 11:55 - Jhyan: Oops
2020/12/18, 11:56 - Jhyan: I typed it out but it sounds just as insane as always. The first step would be to start my own business. Everything after that is kinda a giant leap
2020/12/18, 11:58 - Jhyan: Oh I've told you about it before
2020/12/18, 12:00 - Jhyan: If you for some reason go and find it it's far from what it's been refined to now
2020/12/18, 12:01 - Jhyan: And I cringe when I look at my old version
2020/12/18, 12:04 - Jhyan: https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/
2020/12/18, 12:06 - Jhyan: Idk this conversation makes me anxious
2020/12/18, 12:08 - Adela: oh i’ll try and find it
2020/12/18, 12:08 - Jhyan: No please
2020/12/18, 12:08 - Adela: don’t worry, we don’t need to have the conversation if it makes you feel like that
2020/12/18, 12:09 - Jhyan: It's the only thing that keeps me going at this point actually. It's close to the core of my identity. Despite how impossible it seems, it's the only thing I ever want to do.
2020/12/18, 12:09 - Adela: what is this?
2020/12/18, 12:09 - Adela: oh i get you but that’s great
2020/12/18, 12:09 - Jhyan: A lot of my core assumptions about reality are codependent on the path I want to attempt
2020/12/18, 12:10 - Jhyan: It's a research organisation focused on finding "the cure for aging" aka immortality
2020/12/18, 12:10 - Adela: oh i’m not really into immortality
2020/12/18, 12:10 - Jhyan: Why
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Adela: like the world is overpopulated as is and the very meaning of life is that it ends at some point, which makes our short time on this earth meaningful. and immortality would create more poverty within the world because only the rich would be immortal.
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Jhyan: Altered Carbon explores that
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Jhyan: I agree
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Adela: also it doesn’t allow for new ideas because then you have things that don’t change and as generations evolve, we become better with new ideas and all of that would end
2020/12/18, 12:11 - Jhyan: It would be disastrous if it were accessible
2020/12/18, 12:12 - Jhyan: In any capacity to a group of people
2020/12/18, 12:12 - Adela: it would be
2020/12/18, 12:12 - Adela: it would probably create war because immortality means power
2020/12/18, 12:12 - Jhyan: It ranges from functionally literally infinite inequality to unimaginable catastrophic overpopulation
2020/12/18, 12:13 - Jhyan: It only works if birth is somehow controlled or lessened and it's accessible to every person as a right or something
2020/12/18, 12:14 - Jhyan: And obviously forcefully controlled birth rates are dystopian and unwanted
2020/12/18, 12:16 - Jhyan: * ~literally~
2020/12/18, 12:20 - Jhyan: Yeah ok let's do this
2020/12/18, 12:24 - Jhyan: Idk if you've ever watched Kurzgesagt but they make really high quality animations on cool concepts
2020/12/18, 12:24 - Jhyan: Like I mean professional audio production quality
2020/12/18, 12:24 - Jhyan: *studio
2020/12/18, 12:24 - Jhyan: On YouTube
2020/12/18, 12:28 - Jhyan: They spend over a thousand hours on each video apparently
2020/12/18, 12:42 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFxKZRyQt4
2020/12/18, 12:42 - Jhyan: That is one of my favourite videos from them
2020/12/18, 21:00 - Jhyan: I'm making this
2020/12/18, 21:02 - Jhyan: I'm making a program that takes a chat txt file, separates received messages and responses into batches and then I'll run it through a neural network and see if it gains the ability to respond to messages
2020/12/18, 23:00 - Adela: why would one require that?
2020/12/18, 23:00 - Jhyan: Idk I'm just making it as a project
2020/12/18, 23:00 - Jhyan: But it has other applications
2020/12/18, 23:00 - Adela: oh that’s cool then
2020/12/18, 23:01 - Adela: exactly
2020/12/18, 23:01 - Jhyan: Like it could be reformatted into a keyboard to give way better personalised suggestions
2020/12/18, 23:02 - Jhyan: Like at the top of the keyboard it would know what you want to say before you said it depending on how good it is
2020/12/19, 12:18 - Jhyan: Do you know what a quaternion is
2020/12/19, 12:19 - Jhyan: They're a type of number under the quaternion number system, which is to complex numbers what complex numbers are to real numbers
2020/12/19, 12:20 - Jhyan: They fundamentally change how numbers work. Like multiplication is not commutative anymore
2020/12/19, 12:20 - Jhyan: And it gets worse
2020/12/19, 12:21 - Jhyan: There's also a thing called octonions
2020/12/19, 17:14 - Adela: i do not
2020/12/19, 17:15 - Adela: that sounds so complicated
2020/12/19, 17:15 - Jhyan: Yeah I looked at it for a few minutes and gave up out of fear
2020/12/19, 17:15 - Adela: oh that’s really cool, apple keyboards kind of do thag
2020/12/19, 17:15 - Adela: that*
2020/12/19, 17:15 - Jhyan: They're used in quantum physics
2020/12/19, 17:16 - Jhyan: Well they all do but they use simple algorithms.
2020/12/19, 17:16 - Adela: like they pick up on the way that you speak and then suggest words that align with it
2020/12/19, 17:16 - Adela: obviously it could improve though
2020/12/19, 17:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/19, 17:16 - Jhyan: Idk it might not even work
2020/12/21, 00:00 - Jhyan: I'm leaving tomorrow
2020/12/21, 00:00 - Jhyan: Oh I guess today lmao
2020/12/21, 12:02 - Jhyan: I got stuck on the road
2020/12/21, 12:03 - Jhyan: We're waiting for AA to tow us
2020/12/21, 12:10 - Adela: oh damn, what happened?
2020/12/21, 12:10 - Adela: whete are you off to?
2020/12/21, 12:10 - Jhyan: The engine is overheating for some reason
2020/12/21, 12:10 - Jhyan: George
2020/12/21, 12:11 - Jhyan: Tanya went there last year
2020/12/21, 12:11 - Jhyan: Or was going to
2020/12/21, 12:11 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/12/21, 12:12 - Jhyan: We were going to make plans to meet because I still did debating with her back then. I was surprised because it was her suggestion. I think she never ended up going
2020/12/21, 12:13 - Jhyan: Maybe this is cosmic payback for being lucky enough to be in a dark area for this star alignment thing that only happens every 800 years
2020/12/21, 12:32 - Adela: i don’t think she went
2020/12/21, 12:32 - Adela: the only time we’ll see it in our lifetime
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Jhyan: Unless immortality becomes a thing huh
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Adela: i wouldn’t want it
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Jhyan: I know
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Adela: so this is the last time for me
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/12/21, 12:33 - Jhyan: I guess it was a bad joke then
2020/12/21, 12:34 - Jhyan: Yeah I'm just bored
2020/12/21, 12:34 - Jhyan: Luckily I brought a bunch of books with me
2020/12/21, 12:34 - Adela: have you guys not been towed yet?
2020/12/21, 12:34 - Jhyan: This is the only time I have to read because there's no internet
2020/12/21, 12:35 - Jhyan: Nah they said it was high traffic or something so it took 3 hours and they're about 30km from us rn
2020/12/21, 12:35 - Jhyan: 😑
2020/12/21, 12:35 - Jhyan: But whatever
2020/12/21, 12:35 - Jhyan: I was looking forward to clearing my mind anyway
2020/12/21, 12:36 - Jhyan: Actually the heat is the worst part
2020/12/21, 12:36 - Jhyan: We had 4 bottles of ice cold water but we used them all pouring them into the radiator
2020/12/21, 12:37 - Adela: i haven’t read in ages yoh
2020/12/21, 12:37 - Adela: 30kms isn’t tooo bad
2020/12/21, 12:38 - Adela: oh dammit 😭
2020/12/21, 12:43 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/21, 12:44 - Jhyan: That's a shame. I know you enjoy reading
2020/12/21, 12:45 - Adela: i do honestly
2020/12/21, 12:45 - Jhyan: So what have you been up to that's distracting you from reading
2020/12/21, 13:15 - Jhyan: They finally arrived!
2020/12/21, 13:17 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/12/23, 06:11 - Jhyan: So when do you get back from Cape Town?
2020/12/23, 10:37 - Adela: i got back yesterday
2020/12/23, 11:04 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/12/23, 11:04 - Jhyan: I get back on the 4th
2020/12/23, 20:59 - Jhyan: Do you still listen to Creep by Radiohead
2020/12/23, 20:59 - Jhyan: I found it again and it reminded me of 2 years ago
2020/12/23, 21:00 - Jhyan: You told me about the song
2020/12/23, 21:00 - Jhyan: I've had it in my main playlist ever since
2020/12/23, 21:57 - Adela: i indeed do
2020/12/23, 21:57 - Adela: i love the song so much and i’m really glad i got you into it
2020/12/23, 21:57 - Adela: it’s a beautiful song
2020/12/23, 22:13 - Jhyan: :)
2020/12/24, 15:33 - Jhyan: I always trailblaze hikes
2020/12/24, 15:33 - Jhyan: I go ahead and run through them as fast as possible
2020/12/24, 22:54 - Jhyan: Do you often analyse your messages
2020/12/24, 22:54 - Jhyan: Like not the content but the behaviour
2020/12/24, 22:56 - Jhyan: Like message to response ratio, length in words, level of time density etc.
2020/12/24, 23:00 - Jhyan: I don't do it in detail I'm just intuitively aware of it but I'm busy making that AI
2020/12/24, 23:01 - Jhyan: Also happy Christmas Eve if that's something people say?
2020/12/24, 23:02 - Adela: idk how to say it, but merry christmas (eve)
2020/12/24, 23:02 - Adela: sometimes i do
2020/12/24, 23:02 - Jhyan: Interesting
2020/12/24, 23:03 - Jhyan: Not even sarcastically
2020/12/24, 23:03 - Jhyan: People have diluted words like this
2020/12/24, 23:08 - Adela: that’s really true
2020/12/24, 23:09 - Jhyan: I went on a hike earlier through a proper forest that looks like it's from Lord of The Rings or something
2020/12/25, 02:29 - Adela: that sounds so beautiful 🥺
2020/12/25, 14:15 - Jhyan: Do you want a cool song
2020/12/25, 14:15 - Jhyan: Well I don't know if you'll think it's cool
2020/12/25, 14:15 - Jhyan: It's actually kinda wierd
2020/12/25, 14:15 - Jhyan: But I think it's cool
2020/12/25, 14:16 - Jhyan: It's called The Quiet Earth by Thomas Barrandon
2020/12/26, 21:16 - Jhyan: Hey so can we please do this? I'm coming back in 6 days or something
2020/12/27, 01:54 - Adela: what day works for you?
2020/12/27, 01:55 - Adela: i’ll listen to it, thank you ❤️❤️
2020/12/27, 09:48 - Jhyan: Any day should work since we'll still be on holiday
2020/12/27, 09:48 - Jhyan: The original date I was given to arrive back was the 4th
2020/12/27, 09:50 - Jhyan: And we come back to school the 13th I think
2020/12/27, 09:51 - Jhyan: So maybe the 9th if you don't already have plans? Otherwise any day from the 4th to the 8th
2020/12/27, 09:53 - Jhyan: Or 10th to 12th
2020/12/27, 09:58 - Jhyan: You can choose 🔵
2020/12/27, 13:19 - Adela: i can do the 4th?
2020/12/27, 13:20 - Jhyan: That should work
2020/12/27, 13:20 - Jhyan: If I'm back
2020/12/27, 13:21 - Jhyan: I'm checking now
2020/12/27, 13:21 - Adela: okay cool
2020/12/27, 13:21 - Adela: otherwise another date can work
2020/12/27, 13:21 - Jhyan: 🧊
2020/12/27, 14:29 - Jhyan: I got an answer, I will be back in time for the 4th ✅
2020/12/27, 14:39 - Adela: oh perfect
2020/12/27, 17:18 - Jhyan: I didn't take any pictures unfortunately, but there was an 800 year old tree and moss and streams running across the trail and apparently there used to be white elephants in that forest
2020/12/29, 11:51 - Jhyan: How are you feeling about next year?
2020/12/29, 12:59 - Adela: i try not to think about it too much, like i don’t want to get my hopes up
2020/12/29, 13:00 - Jhyan: You're just waiting to see what happens
2020/12/29, 13:00 - Jhyan: What about school?
2020/12/29, 13:01 - Jhyan: You said you were excited for it to be over soon
2020/12/29, 13:20 - Adela: i mean i am excited for it to be over
2020/12/29, 13:20 - Adela: but i don’t wanna try to predict how the year could go
2020/12/29, 13:25 - Jhyan: I get you
2020/12/29, 13:28 - Jhyan: I remember back in January or February or something
2020/12/29, 13:29 - Jhyan: Mr Colesky told us to do a report on the virus and how it would impact business
2020/12/29, 13:29 - Jhyan: I said it wouldn't really be that bad
2020/12/29, 13:29 - Jhyan: I was so wrong
2020/12/29, 13:30 - Jhyan: It looked less serious then, and I didn't take into account the sociology of people, only the virus itself
2020/12/29, 21:04 - Adela: yeah it seemed a lot better then
2020/12/29, 21:05 - Adela: no one could really predict the full impact of it
2020/12/30, 16:32 - Jhyan: When you were in Cape Town were there a lot of people not wearing masks?
2020/12/30, 16:33 - Jhyan: The garden route is flagged as a hotspot zone or whatever and where I am people are really lax about wearing them
2020/12/30, 16:34 - Adela: yeah there were
2020/12/30, 16:34 - Jhyan: That's sad
2020/12/30, 16:34 - Jhyan: Apparently it's super bad there
2020/12/30, 16:35 - Jhyan: Like just the statistics
2020/12/30, 21:59 - Jhyan: You never said anything about the song that's weird and cool
2020/12/30, 22:11 - Jhyan: I mean you don't have to, but if you enjoyed it then it would be cool to know I sent you a song you liked
2020/12/30, 22:19 - Jhyan: Or if you didn't like it. I just want to know what you thought
2020/12/31, 00:33 - Adela: it is quite, and also kzn seems to be doing really badly. generally sa rn is reaching the highest daily infection rate that we have ever had
2020/12/31, 00:33 - Adela: i do like it, i just wish that it had words? i feel like that defeats the purpose of the song though because it is a good instrumental regardless.
2020/12/31, 09:17 - Jhyan: I listen to a lot of lyricless songs
2020/12/31, 09:26 - Jhyan: I guess it's not a song then
2020/12/31, 09:27 - Jhyan: Music
2020/12/31, 09:28 - Jhyan: I looked up the definition and apparently it requires lyrics
2020/12/31, 09:38 - Jhyan: I used to hate lyrics
2020/12/31, 09:39 - Jhyan: They fixed the narrative and they were usually about stuff I didn't care about and/or couldn't relate to
2020/12/31, 18:11 - Adela: i find that lyrics help me a lot
2020/12/31, 18:11 - Adela: especially things i can relate to
2020/12/31, 18:12 - Jhyan: You always sing them
2020/12/31, 18:12 - Jhyan: I could probably count on my fingers how many songs I can relate to
2020/12/31, 19:06 - Jhyan: Like when you fell off your chair 😂
2020/12/31, 19:15 - Adela: i hate hornets 😭
2020/12/31, 19:15 - Jhyan: I've never seen a hornet in my life
2020/12/31, 19:15 - Jhyan: But they sound terrifying
2020/12/31, 19:16 - Jhyan: Bees are scary enough
2020/12/31, 19:16 - Jhyan: And then wasps also crop up around my house
2020/12/31, 19:16 - Jhyan: Oh wait I have but it was dead
2020/12/31, 19:17 - Adela: i did the ar thing of a hornet on youtube and it was absolutely terrifying
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Jhyan: Oh Jesus
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Jhyan: I just remembered there's giant ones in Asia
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Jhyan: Like the size of your hand
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: yeah asian giant hornet
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: they’re like 4-5cm
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: and fly at 40km/h
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Jhyan: Your palm then
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: i would literally pass out if i saw that
2020/12/31, 19:18 - Adela: pretty much
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Jhyan: Yeah the only way you're surviving is with a baseball bat
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Jhyan: Or a tennis racket
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Adela: like i’m not that scared of bees because they actually serve a purpose and they die once they sting you
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Adela: hornets can sting you multiple times and are pretty much pests
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Jhyan: I saw a wasp acting like a bee the other day
2020/12/31, 19:19 - Jhyan: It was strange
2020/12/31, 19:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/12/31, 19:22 - Jhyan: Believe it or not it's actually just a type of fly
2020/12/31, 19:50 - Adela: can it sting?
2020/12/31, 19:50 - Adela: that is really strange
2020/12/31, 19:51 - Adela: how was it acting like a bee
2020/12/31, 19:51 - Jhyan: No
2020/12/31, 19:51 - Jhyan: Well it was dead
2020/12/31, 19:51 - Jhyan: I had to go onto a specialised online forum for people who like insects to ask what it was
2020/12/31, 19:52 - Jhyan: Because it looks much more menacing
2020/12/31, 19:52 - Jhyan: It was flying from flower to flower as if it was getting nectar
2020/12/31, 19:53 - Jhyan: But there were like 20 bees around it doing the same thing in the bush
2020/12/31, 19:53 - Jhyan: It was like the ugly duckling but a wasp
2020/12/31, 19:53 - Jhyan: Or maybe they are supposed to do that but I've never seen them doing that
2020/12/31, 19:55 - Jhyan: I also saw an epic battle between a wasp and a so spider unfolding in my garden
2020/12/31, 19:55 - Jhyan: A few years ago
2020/12/31, 20:27 - Jhyan: I think I walked past it later and saw the wasp dragging the spider away
2020/12/31, 20:57 - Jhyan: I was gonna ask if you were staying up for New Year's but you literally do that every day
2021/01/01, 00:00 - Jhyan: Happy New Year's, Adela 🥂
2021/01/01, 00:00 - Adela: happy new year jhyan ❤️
2021/01/01, 00:01 - Adela: yeah they’re not supposed to
2021/01/01, 00:01 - Adela: wasps are really deadly
2021/01/01, 00:01 - Jhyan: I guess it didn't turn out to be like everyone joked
2021/01/01, 00:02 - Jhyan: 31/12/20

01/13/20
2021/01/01, 00:13 - Adela: that would be a nightmare
2021/01/01, 00:14 - Jhyan: Instead we get the arbitrary human constructs of time to make us feel relieved
2021/01/01, 00:15 - Jhyan: Anyway
2021/01/01, 00:15 - Jhyan: I'm probably just gonna sleep
2021/01/01, 00:16 - Jhyan: I didn't really have a plan for after 00:00, I'm just in bed
2021/01/01, 00:16 - Jhyan: Good night 🤍
2021/01/01, 00:16 - Adela: i didn’t even notice that 00:00 came around
2021/01/01, 00:16 - Adela: good night ❤️
2021/01/01, 20:24 - Jhyan: I'm in Cape Town
2021/01/01, 20:24 - Jhyan: But only for one night
2021/01/02, 14:19 - Jhyan: So what time do you want to go to Rosebank on Monday?
2021/01/02, 17:07 - Adela: it’s really last minute, but can we move it to tuesday afternoon?
2021/01/02, 17:07 - Adela: at like 2-3?
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Jhyan: Sure
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Adela: okay cool
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Jhyan: It's just one day
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Adela: im so sorry for rescheduling
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Jhyan: I don't mind
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Adela: we don’t have to do 2-3 if you dont want to
2021/01/02, 17:08 - Adela: i can do any time after 11:30
2021/01/02, 17:13 - Jhyan: Honestly it was only stressful when I didn't know any details like a month ago so it's alright
2021/01/02, 17:15 - Jhyan: I was gonna say earlier that the time doesn't really matter because I'm not doing anything so the times I gave were just a suggestion. I'm happy to do 2
2021/01/02, 17:16 - Jhyan: 🔵
2021/01/02, 17:25 - Adela: okay that’s cool
2021/01/02, 17:26 - Adela: oh that’s good, sorry again
2021/01/04, 15:38 - Jhyan: I just did one of those word origin things
2021/01/04, 15:38 - Jhyan: This
2021/01/04, 15:38 - Jhyan: It's a recurring one that I think when I encounter the word "use"
2021/01/04, 15:39 - Jhyan: I have a suspicion that it's a shortened version of utilise
2021/01/04, 15:39 - Jhyan: But I've never confirmed it
2021/01/04, 15:41 - Jhyan: I just did it now and apparently I was wrong but they do seem to have the same origin from Latin
2021/01/04, 15:44 - Adela: shit jhyan, i’m so sorry and this is the absolute last time i reschedule, but i realised that tomorrow is like a special day so can we please do wednesday?
2021/01/04, 15:44 - Adela: it’s my anniversary and such
2021/01/04, 15:45 - Adela: a lot of words come from latin?
2021/01/04, 15:45 - Jhyan: Ok no worries
2021/01/04, 15:45 - Jhyan: Yeah but they come from the same Latin word
2021/01/04, 16:34 - Jhyan: Do you want to keep the same time at 2?
2021/01/04, 17:03 - Adela: yes please
2021/01/04, 17:04 - Jhyan: 🧊
2021/01/04, 22:40 - Jhyan: Good night, enjoy your anniversary tomorrow
2021/01/04, 23:08 - Adela: thanks so much jhyan
good night
2021/01/05, 20:58 - Adela: so what are the finalised plans for tomorrow?
2021/01/05, 20:58 - Jhyan: Rosebank at 2?
2021/01/05, 20:58 - Adela: where are we meeting in rosebank?
2021/01/05, 20:58 - Jhyan: Where's a good place
2021/01/05, 21:01 - Jhyan: I'm thinking
2021/01/05, 21:02 - Adela: well the main idea is to go to exclusive books, right?
2021/01/05, 21:03 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/05, 21:03 - Adela: we can meet there, right?
2021/01/05, 21:03 - Adela: outside by the coffee place
2021/01/05, 21:04 - Adela: because there’s a seattle there
2021/01/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2021/01/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: I know where the Seattle is
2021/01/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: That works
2021/01/05, 21:05 - Jhyan: All good?
2021/01/05, 21:05 - Adela: yeah that’s good
2021/01/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: Perfect
2021/01/06, 01:16 - Adela: so ill see you tomorrow
2021/01/06, 01:17 - Jhyan: Looking forward to it
2021/01/06, 01:17 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙
2021/01/06, 13:14 - Adela: hey jhyan, i may be slightly late
2021/01/06, 13:14 - Adela: i only woke up now
2021/01/06, 13:14 - Adela: i’ll stay in touch though
2021/01/06, 13:15 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2021/01/06, 13:34 - Jhyan: Yeah just give me an estimate when you can
2021/01/06, 13:34 - Adela: probably 2:30-45
2021/01/06, 13:55 - Jhyan: Well I'm here
2021/01/06, 13:55 - Adela: shit i’ll be there soon
2021/01/06, 13:55 - Jhyan: My mom said she had some stuff to do anyway so I'll just tag along until you get here
2021/01/06, 13:56 - Jhyan: Don't overly rush or anything is my point
2021/01/06, 14:14 - Adela: i’m on my way niw
2021/01/06, 14:14 - Jhyan: 👌🏻
2021/01/06, 14:26 - Adela: i’m here
2021/01/06, 14:26 - Jhyan: I'm at the Seattle
2021/01/06, 14:26 - Adela: but not by exclusive books yet
2021/01/06, 14:26 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/06, 14:26 - Adela: cool i’ll be there soon
2021/01/06, 14:27 - Jhyan: Wait just to be clear, it's the Seattle at the edge of the parking lot right?
2021/01/06, 14:28 - Adela: i meant the one by exclusive books but i know which one you are talking abt so i’ll come to you
2021/01/06, 14:28 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2021/01/06, 14:29 - Jhyan: I didn't know the one integrated into Exclusive was a Seattle
2021/01/06, 16:53 - Adela: thank you so much for the time in rosebank, sorry for making you waiy
2021/01/06, 16:53 - Adela: wait*
2021/01/06, 16:55 - Jhyan: Of course
2021/01/06, 16:55 - Jhyan: It was really not a problem :)
2021/01/06, 17:10 - Jhyan: I enjoyed it, if that needs to be said
2021/01/06, 23:18 - Jhyan: This took 2 years to happen
2021/01/06, 23:18 - Adela: oh my, that’s really crazy 😭
2021/01/06, 23:18 - Adela: i also enjoyed it
2021/01/06, 23:21 - Jhyan: I find it intriguing because this specific information can generate insight into the last few years and my mind. It provides a direct thought path over a long period of time which is very rare
2021/01/06, 23:21 - Jhyan: But it's also strange to think about
2021/01/06, 23:21 - Jhyan: I'm glad
2021/01/06, 23:26 - Jhyan: Is it weird that I remembered it?
2021/01/06, 23:27 - Jhyan: I could justify why it's not weird but it seems like something like this would seem weird usually to most people
2021/01/06, 23:57 - Adela: no it’s not
2021/01/06, 23:57 - Adela: it is really strange
2021/01/06, 23:57 - Jhyan: Okay cool
2021/01/06, 23:58 - Jhyan: I don't really know what's normal and what's weird because the boundaries have blurred too much
2021/01/06, 23:59 - Jhyan: I'm sure I'll end up analysing it with context and stuff at some point
2021/01/07, 17:43 - Jhyan: Let's say you slice through all the noodles in a bowl of spaghetti so that there are two equal halves of the bowl. Do you think the individual average noodle length will halve?
2021/01/07, 17:43 - Jhyan: I had that thought one time and now I think about it every time I eat spaghetti
2021/01/07, 17:51 - Jhyan: There is a paper dedicated just to the nature of geometry of coin shaped cylindrical objects randomly tossed into a box so I'm sure if someone spent so much time on that that it could be solved mathematically but it's interesting to think about
2021/01/07, 18:52 - Adela: i don’t think it would
2021/01/07, 18:52 - Adela: because that would mean that every noodle is wrapped perfectly
2021/01/07, 18:53 - Jhyan: That's why I said average
2021/01/07, 18:54 - Jhyan: Unless I'm misinterpreting what you meant
2021/01/07, 18:56 - Jhyan: I agree that it wouldn't be but because if a noodle gets cut twice because it crosses the line at 2 points then it can only lower the average, and nothing can increase the average
2021/01/07, 18:56 - Jhyan: So nothing would balance it out
2021/01/07, 18:56 - Jhyan: Or more than 2
2021/01/08, 01:42 - Jhyan: Do you still draw ever?
2021/01/08, 14:37 - Adela: i’m painting something right now but i lost a lot of inspiration
2021/01/08, 14:38 - Adela: exactly
2021/01/08, 14:39 - Jhyan: I feel that
2021/01/09, 17:46 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/01/09, 21:03 - Adela: no not at all
2021/01/09, 21:04 - Jhyan: It's a car frame designed by an AI
2021/01/09, 21:04 - Jhyan: It's starting to be used in aircraft
2021/01/09, 21:05 - Jhyan: The AI design process
2021/01/09, 21:57 - Jhyan: Did I ever tell you about the time a fly got stuck in my hair
2021/01/10, 10:53 - Adela: no you never did
2021/01/10, 10:53 - Adela: oh that’s really cool
2021/01/10, 12:47 - Jhyan: So I was just going about my day normally, walking, when a fly suddenly gets the bright idea to slam right into my hair, which is curly. I imagine that makes it hard to escape for an insect.

It freaks out for a bit, starts buzzing, and of course this is close to my ear so I also spazz out and try to beat it out of my hair. Eventually it stops buzzing because it's gone.

Later, as I'm changing to go to bed, my shirt knocks some black thing out of my hair, and I realise it's The Fly™ which had just decided to give up and wait.

I was horrified. Insects flying into my hair had been and still is a frequent enough occurrence, but this had never happened. They always escaped seconds later.
2021/01/10, 12:47 - Jhyan: So if you ever see me violently flinching from seemingly nothing, now you know why
2021/01/10, 12:48 - Jhyan: I'm assuming it just went into a dormant state like they do if they ever get stuck in a fridge
2021/01/10, 12:48 - Jhyan: I highly doubt it was crawling around
2021/01/10, 12:48 - Jhyan: But still
2021/01/10, 12:52 - Jhyan: And it's not _actually_ frequent, it's just that it's happened enough times and is horrible enough for me to actively avoid all insects
2021/01/10, 12:52 - Jhyan: It's like being cautious at a junction because of hijackers
2021/01/10, 15:35 - Jhyan: Btw did you see that physics paper that was posted
2021/01/10, 17:23 - Adela: i haven’t really kept up to date with school notifications
2021/01/10, 18:50 - Jhyan: Did you hear about the whole WhatsApp privacy policy thing
2021/01/10, 18:50 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I guess you use iMessage mostly
2021/01/10, 19:38 - Adela: i did indeed
2021/01/10, 19:38 - Jhyan: I downloaded Telegram
2021/01/10, 19:38 - Adela: i actually use both equally, but like i don’t really use them that much
2021/01/10, 19:38 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/10, 19:39 - Jhyan: Facebook pretty much has an monopoly
2021/01/11, 16:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/01/11, 17:04 - Jhyan: That sentence is pretty illegible
2021/01/11, 17:04 - Jhyan: Or just badly written
2021/01/11, 17:04 - Jhyan: But yeah
2021/01/12, 19:58 - Jhyan: 25 million active users joined in the last 72 hours apparently
2021/01/12, 19:58 - Jhyan: I didn't actually think there would be a difference
2021/01/14, 23:54 - Jhyan: What do you think of Bitcoin?
2021/01/15, 00:05 - Jhyan: Also have you read the Afrikaans and English books
2021/01/15, 10:06 - Adela: no i haven’t
2021/01/15, 10:07 - Adela: oh those look pretty cool
2021/01/15, 10:07 - Adela: i don’t really think about it much 😂
2021/01/15, 10:11 - Jhyan: 2 years ago I mined some with my computer
2021/01/15, 10:11 - Jhyan: I put it in a Bitcoin wallet
2021/01/15, 10:12 - Jhyan: And then I lost it when one time the power went out and corrupted my OS and I lost all my files
2021/01/15, 10:12 - Jhyan: When I fixed my computer I tried getting it back by using a code to regenerate the wallet but for some reason it didn't work
2021/01/15, 10:12 - Jhyan: And then 2 days ago I randomly stumbled across the wallet software and tried again
2021/01/15, 10:13 - Jhyan: I didn't really care because it was only worth like R200
2021/01/15, 10:13 - Jhyan: But now it's worth R1500
2021/01/15, 11:54 - Adela: that’s so much money
2021/01/15, 11:55 - Jhyan: I started mining again
2021/01/15, 11:55 - Jhyan: It should be even more in the future
2021/01/16, 14:07 - Jhyan: I feel your pain now
2021/01/16, 14:07 - Jhyan: I broke my nail
2021/01/16, 14:07 - Jhyan: ☹️
2021/01/16, 18:15 - Adela: it’s literally the worst feeling yoh
2021/01/16, 18:15 - Adela: yeah ive heard that it just keeps on growing
2021/01/16, 18:16 - Jhyan: At least I can try playing piano again
2021/01/16, 18:16 - Adela: there’s always a bright side
2021/01/16, 23:08 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/01/16, 23:09 - Jhyan: I mean it's not like I was just practicing this simple music box tune for 5 hours but I just thought it was worth sharing
2021/01/17, 09:32 - Jhyan: What are you going to do with this
2021/01/17, 12:39 - Adela: i’ll do it
2021/01/17, 12:40 - Jhyan: In less than 24 hours?
2021/01/17, 12:40 - Adela: this is so nice, it sounds like a tune in a christmas movie
2021/01/17, 12:40 - Adela: so so
2021/01/17, 15:04 - Jhyan: _"The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural"_
2021/01/17, 17:30 - Jhyan: How anxious do you get before exams
2021/01/17, 17:30 - Jhyan: If you do
2021/01/17, 17:31 - Adela: really anxious
2021/01/17, 17:32 - Jhyan: What do you do to cope
2021/01/17, 17:38 - Adela: i don’t really cope 😂
2021/01/17, 18:35 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/17, 18:35 - Jhyan: Does the anxiety push you to procrastinate
2021/01/17, 18:36 - Jhyan: Well I meant like how do you still manage to not just catastrophically fail
2021/01/17, 18:36 - Jhyan: I never used to feel anxious about school until last year
2021/01/17, 18:37 - Jhyan: Maybe because I needed the marks for provisional acceptance or maybe the uncertainty of covid made it worse or idk
2021/01/17, 18:40 - Jhyan: Anyway so maybe you have some wisdom
2021/01/17, 19:24 - Adela: no it doesn’t really
2021/01/17, 19:25 - Adela: idk, i basically just use the anxiety to work, i get no sleep. i do nothing i find fun and then i get it done
2021/01/17, 19:25 - Adela: i’m not exactly someone to ask for that help because i barely manage myself
2021/01/17, 19:26 - Jhyan: What are you referring to here
2021/01/17, 19:26 - Adela: with the whole coping mechanisms
2021/01/17, 19:49 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/17, 19:50 - Jhyan: I interpreted the sentence the other way
2021/01/17, 19:50 - Jhyan: Like you're not the person [who would] ask
2021/01/17, 19:51 - Jhyan: Not you're the type of person [that would be useful for another to] ask
2021/01/17, 19:51 - Jhyan: I also do the fun cutting thing
2021/01/17, 19:51 - Jhyan: I just get too scared to do anything that wastes time
2021/01/17, 19:52 - Jhyan: So I end up not doing anything for a few weeks
2021/01/17, 20:57 - Adela: oh i get how it would be ambigious
2021/01/17, 20:57 - Adela: ambiguous *
2021/01/17, 20:57 - Adela: exactly
2021/01/17, 21:16 - Jhyan: Damn I keep missing your messages somehow
2021/01/17, 21:29 - Jhyan: Paradoxically it leads me to do literally nothing for some of the time, making it even more of a waste
2021/01/17, 21:31 - Jhyan: So are you just trying not to think of the future and just hoping you'll develop good strategies later on?
2021/01/17, 21:32 - Jhyan: That question can be interpreted as critical because of the way I phrased it but I'm just curious
2021/01/18, 21:24 - Jhyan: PAT phase 1 is due on your birthday
2021/01/18, 21:28 - Adela: oh god no 😭
2021/01/18, 21:29 - Adela: i guess so 😂
2021/01/18, 22:25 - Jhyan: Well thank you for sharing your experience with exam stress
2021/01/18, 22:25 - Adela: of course, you’re welcome
2021/01/19, 11:40 - Jhyan: He's asking for you in the physics meet
2021/01/19, 11:40 - Adela: thank you 😂
2021/01/19, 11:40 - Jhyan: Np
2021/01/19, 18:59 - Jhyan: Didn't you say you were going to do AP English
2021/01/19, 18:59 - Adela: i am indeed doing it
2021/01/19, 18:59 - Jhyan: Should I add you to the group
2021/01/19, 18:59 - Jhyan: On WhatsApp
2021/01/19, 18:59 - Adela: yes please
2021/01/19, 19:36 - Jhyan: Were you at the information evening yesterday?
2021/01/19, 19:36 - Jhyan: Digitally obviously
2021/01/19, 19:51 - Adela: i was indeed
2021/01/19, 20:06 - Jhyan: Lmao my mom was like "thanks Faeza" at some point
2021/01/19, 20:06 - Jhyan: With my account
2021/01/19, 20:06 - Jhyan: On the chat
2021/01/19, 20:38 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2021/01/19, 20:38 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/01/19, 20:39 - Jhyan: I'm just reading the business chapter
2021/01/19, 22:38 - Adela: it seems quite thick
2021/01/19, 22:39 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/19, 22:39 - Jhyan: There's also a lot of spelling mistakes
2021/01/19, 22:39 - Adela: oh no
2021/01/19, 22:39 - Jhyan: I mean they were more humorous then anything
2021/01/19, 22:39 - Adela: next business lesson is on thursday
2021/01/19, 22:40 - Jhyan: The content seems fine
2021/01/19, 22:40 - Jhyan: Well I finished it
2021/01/19, 22:41 - Adela: i’ll do it tomorrow
2021/01/19, 22:41 - Adela: i wanted to focus on catching up with the afrikaans book today
2021/01/19, 22:41 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2021/01/19, 22:41 - Jhyan: I didn't start that
2021/01/19, 22:42 - Jhyan: I thought about doing that but I'm relying on the good old trick of nobody else doing it either
2021/01/19, 22:42 - Jhyan: I'll see the situation tomorrow and if it's dire then I'll speedrun the book
2021/01/19, 22:43 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2021/01/19, 22:43 - Jhyan: There's probably a name for it in sociology or something
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Jhyan: Can you please send me a picture of checkpoint 1?
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Adela: okay let me go and get it
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Jhyan: She said it was included but it's not
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Adela: i can’t get the slideshow to play
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Jhyan: Oh you're still having trouble
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Jhyan: I think you have to have PowerPoint installed
2021/01/20, 12:44 - Adela: i do
2021/01/20, 12:46 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2021/01/20, 12:46 - Jhyan: I can try give suggestions to solve it if you want but idk how helpful it'll be
2021/01/20, 12:47 - Adela: please
2021/01/20, 12:47 - Jhyan: Thanks
2021/01/20, 12:47 - Jhyan: Ok so you downloaded the file and opened it in PowerPoint?
2021/01/20, 12:48 - Adela: yhup
2021/01/20, 12:48 - Jhyan: Does it automatically play the presentation itself
2021/01/20, 12:49 - Jhyan: Like if you leave it on slide 1 without touching it does it eventually automatically go to slide 2
2021/01/20, 12:49 - Adela: it does
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Adela: it’s saying that the media is unavailable
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Jhyan: Maybe the file is corrupted?
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Adela: <Media omitted>
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Adela: this*
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Jhyan: I'm sure you've tried redownloading it
2021/01/20, 12:50 - Adela: yhup i have
2021/01/20, 12:51 - Jhyan: Yeah that's strange
2021/01/20, 12:51 - Jhyan: Is it in protected view? Maybe that's interfering with it
2021/01/20, 12:53 - Adela: it is
2021/01/20, 12:53 - Jhyan: Try turning that off
2021/01/20, 12:54 - Jhyan: Otherwise it seems to be an unsupported file type so that leads me to think maybe your PowerPoint is an older version
2021/01/20, 12:53 - Adela: i turned it off
2021/01/20, 12:54 - Adela: but there is still no sound
2021/01/20, 12:54 - Jhyan: But like this is mostly speculation
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Adela: i’m not sure
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Adela: she said she could post the video so i guess
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Jhyan: Did you download it through the school
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Jhyan: Or did you always have it
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Adela: i always had it
2021/01/20, 12:56 - Jhyan: I downloaded mine through the school account so it was the newest version at the time
2021/01/20, 12:57 - Adela: which email did you use for that
2021/01/20, 12:57 - Jhyan: Let me check
2021/01/20, 12:57 - Jhyan: adamj21@shc.org.za
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Adela: oh thank you
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Jhyan: I think the password is supposed to be the same as the school WiFi password
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Jhyan: But I'm not sure
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Adela: i got into it
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Adela: it’s the one for adam
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Jhyan: Oh cool
2021/01/20, 12:58 - Jhyan: Yeah they're all supposed to be the same
2021/01/20, 12:59 - Jhyan: Well hopefully that works
2021/01/20, 12:59 - Adela: i have 2 different ones
2021/01/20, 13:02 - Adela: i got it to work
2021/01/20, 13:02 - Adela: yay
2021/01/20, 13:02 - Adela: thank you
2021/01/20, 13:02 - Jhyan: I'm glad
2021/01/20, 13:02 - Jhyan: 🟢
2021/01/20, 13:07 - Adela: thanks for all of the help
2021/01/20, 13:07 - Adela: i had to get powerpoint online
2021/01/20, 13:08 - Jhyan: Anytime :)
2021/01/20, 16:25 - Jhyan: Do you have a favourite poem?
2021/01/20, 16:28 - Adela: in general?
2021/01/20, 16:28 - Jhyan: What's the alternative?
2021/01/20, 16:28 - Adela: like you could mean out of the english ones or afrikaans ones or som
2021/01/20, 16:29 - Jhyan: Is your favourite one an Afrikaans poem
2021/01/20, 16:31 - Jhyan: I don't mean from school
2021/01/20, 16:32 - Jhyan: I was just rereading my favourite one and remembered you read poetry books
2021/01/20, 16:39 - Adela: i have a few favourites
2021/01/20, 16:40 - Adela: one of my all time favourites must be “funeral blues” by wh auden
2021/01/20, 16:40 - Adela: otherwise i write my own poetry
2021/01/20, 16:40 - Adela: no 😂
2021/01/20, 16:41 - Jhyan: Same! But I kinda stopped
2021/01/20, 16:41 - Jhyan: I'll read it
2021/01/20, 16:55 - Jhyan: I've read this before, probably in AP English
2021/01/20, 17:00 - Jhyan: You've almost definitely read mine too but it's _Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening_ by Robert Frost
2021/01/20, 21:44 - Adela: i don’t think i’ve read it
2021/01/20, 21:44 - Adela: but i’ll go and find it, maybe i have
2021/01/20, 21:44 - Jhyan: It's supposed to be famous
2021/01/20, 21:44 - Jhyan: But idk
2021/01/20, 21:44 - Jhyan: Or maybe it's not
2021/01/20, 22:44 - Adela: oh the poem is really good, i haven’t actually seen it before
2021/01/20, 22:45 - Adela: i don’t really read famous poems, more like underground poets and stuff
2021/01/20, 22:45 - Jhyan: Idk why
2021/01/20, 22:45 - Jhyan: It's so simple
2021/01/20, 22:46 - Jhyan: But like every time I randomly remember it and go back and read it it's still able to illicit a response
2021/01/20, 22:46 - Adela: sometimes simple things resonate with us for reasons beyond explanation
2021/01/20, 22:52 - Jhyan: I didn't really say anything about it earlier but it even when I first read it I thought it really does convey that sense of finality and apathy
2021/01/20, 23:55 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙
2021/01/21, 00:02 - Adela: yeah that one just makes me feel a lot, especially the last two stanzas
2021/01/21, 00:02 - Adela: good night, jhyan
2021/01/21, 07:29 - Jhyan: Do you think it's possible to finish the syllabus if we mark homework every time
2021/01/21, 07:29 - Jhyan: Like we're not even gonna finish marking this homework
2021/01/21, 07:29 - Adela: no it is definitely not
2021/01/21, 07:30 - Jhyan: The worst part is that we can't really do anything to change it
2021/01/21, 07:30 - Adela: yeah we can’t
2021/01/21, 07:31 - Jhyan: We're still probably doing this if you're interested
2021/01/21, 07:33 - Adela: i don’t wanna add more to my plate of work, so i’m going to just do her lessons and then go to mr marais if i need help
2021/01/21, 07:33 - Adela: but i feel like she will go through the syllabus because we have to, even if it means doing boot camps and stuff
2021/01/22, 07:49 - Jhyan: My sister and I got the entire book series for Christmas
2021/01/22, 10:12 - Jhyan: Do you know what's happening rn with AP English
2021/01/22, 10:12 - Adela: i really don’t
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Adela: oh wow
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Adela: have you watch the series
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Adela: how many books are there?
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Jhyan: I just joined the classroom and it seems there was a lesson this morning
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Jhyan: But there's also AP maths lessons on Friday mornings
2021/01/22, 10:13 - Jhyan: Idk like 10
2021/01/22, 10:14 - Adela: that’s a lot yoh
2021/01/22, 10:14 - Adela: she thought that we had ape in the first period 💀
2021/01/22, 10:14 - Jhyan: But he hasn't released the last one yet
2021/01/22, 10:14 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/22, 10:14 - Jhyan: I assumed it was before school started because we've done it like that before
2021/01/22, 10:15 - Adela: no it was at 8:20 meaning she thought it was in the morning morning
2021/01/22, 10:15 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/22, 10:15 - Jhyan: I only registered the time now
2021/01/22, 10:18 - Adela: 😂😂😂
2021/01/22, 10:18 - Adela: but idk what’s going on with the current lesson
2021/01/22, 10:18 - Jhyan: We're supposed to choose a school of poetry
2021/01/22, 10:18 - Jhyan: But I want to ask the differences first
2021/01/22, 10:18 - Adela: idk which one i want to choose
2021/01/22, 10:20 - Jhyan: The link is up on gc
2021/01/22, 10:20 - Jhyan: Oh you saw
2021/01/22, 10:20 - Adela: i did indeed
2021/01/22, 14:10 - Jhyan: Were the ORTs explained earlier
2021/01/22, 14:10 - Adela: they were not really explained as such
2021/01/22, 14:10 - Jhyan: Why is he expecting us to know which subject to do it in then
2021/01/22, 14:11 - Adela: every subject teacher is supposed to explain what the ort requires in their subject
2021/01/22, 14:11 - Adela: yes he said that by friday, we should know
2021/01/22, 14:12 - Jhyan: But it is Friday
2021/01/22, 14:12 - Adela: yes
2021/01/22, 14:12 - Adela: and he told us like on wednesday to figure out which subject we want to do our ORT in
2021/01/22, 14:21 - Jhyan: Are you doing it in business?
2021/01/22, 14:22 - Adela: yeah i think so
2021/01/22, 14:22 - Adela: i don’t want to do it in life orientation which is the only other option
2021/01/22, 14:22 - Adela: because the alternative tasks are gonna be so much easier
2021/01/22, 14:22 - Jhyan: Yeah that makes sense
2021/01/22, 14:22 - Adela: and also we’re already doing research for LO with the CAT
2021/01/22, 14:23 - Jhyan: You said we do a film in business as an alt task?
2021/01/22, 14:25 - Adela: yeah something like that
2021/01/22, 14:25 - Adela: he mentioned a film task
2021/01/22, 14:25 - Jhyan: Like we make a film?
2021/01/22, 14:26 - Jhyan: Well I'm probably doing it in business anyway
2021/01/22, 21:40 - Jhyan: Remember matrices
2021/01/22, 21:41 - Jhyan: From grade 10
2021/01/22, 21:42 - Jhyan: I actually needed that knowledge to make this AI.

It's like I'm answering that question: "when will we need to know this in real life?"
2021/01/22, 21:47 - Jhyan: Do you want to hear about it? Idk if you'd find it interesting
2021/01/23, 22:49 - Jhyan: Did you ever look up HP Lovecraft
2021/01/23, 22:52 - Adela: i do indeed
2021/01/23, 22:52 - Adela: sure, tell me
2021/01/23, 22:52 - Adela: i never did
2021/01/23, 22:52 - Jhyan: I had the idea to show you at the book shop but I was nervous and forgot
2021/01/23, 22:55 - Jhyan: I got to the point where I can format WhatsApp chats into 2D (matrix) data. All I have to do is run the data through an AI and see if it learns how to respond.
2021/01/23, 22:56 - Jhyan: Each input is a batch of received messages and each output is a batch of responses. I made the batch sizes in ratio to the ratio of send to receive
2021/01/23, 22:57 - Jhyan: This is what sparked this question
2021/01/23, 23:26 - Jhyan: Well I looked him up and apparently he was pretty extremely racist which I didn't know so I won't talk about him casually again
2021/01/24, 00:34 - Adela: why were you nervous? 🥴
2021/01/24, 00:35 - Adela: that’s actually really cool. it’s so incredible how maths is like a part of our lives and things that seem so abstract can be used to do useful things.
like i never knew that matrices would have any real purpose
2021/01/24, 00:35 - Adela: that’s really terrible
2021/01/24, 12:30 - Jhyan: I had never done anything like that before and because I value our friendship I was afraid of messing it up
2021/01/24, 12:48 - Adela: im sorry you felt that way, you really couldn’t have messed it up, jhyan
2021/01/24, 14:14 - Jhyan: Thank you 🤍
2021/01/25, 11:52 - Jhyan: What did he say about question 9, I wasn't listening 😬
2021/01/25, 11:52 - Adela: he said change fast food franchise to general merchant
2021/01/25, 11:52 - Jhyan: Oh ok cool thanks
2021/01/26, 19:38 - Jhyan: Is that one of your poems
2021/01/26, 19:40 - Adela: it is indeed
2021/01/26, 19:40 - Jhyan: That's cool
2021/01/26, 20:39 - Jhyan: Have you done the IT exercise
2021/01/26, 20:50 - Adela: i have
2021/01/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: I only saw this now
2021/01/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: It's ok
2021/01/26, 22:07 - Jhyan: There's a problem with it
2021/01/26, 22:07 - Jhyan: And there was also a problem with what she said last lesson that I picked up on
2021/01/26, 22:08 - Jhyan: Nobody else ever sees it so I feel like I'm wrong about seeing the problem and she also doesn't try to see it so she keeps stating erroneous information over and over
2021/01/26, 22:09 - Jhyan: And yeah usually that would mean I am in fact wrong, but when I do my own research I find that I'm not and that either she, the textbook or both are incorrect
2021/01/26, 22:13 - Jhyan: Idk if I sound arrogant. I'm just frustrated because I have to do so much extra work to find the truth. This exercise took me hours because I had to find the right information and write apply it despite problems with the questions
2021/01/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: I probably sound crazy
2021/01/26, 22:19 - Jhyan: But both conspiracy theorists and regular theorists often to before everyone sees the future unfold. Like Michael Burry
2021/01/26, 22:33 - Jhyan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments
2021/01/27, 23:03 - Jhyan: You can ignore all of that, I was tired and frustrated. But the experiments are still pretty interesting on their own if you want to read about them.
2021/01/27, 23:20 - Adela: i didn’t actually find any errors with the IT work, but that’s because i didnt really look deeper than the whole thing. sorry for also not responding, i haven’t really been good at messaging recently, it’s not anything personal
2021/01/28, 13:23 - Jhyan: My power cut
2021/01/28, 13:23 - Jhyan: If You're still there please tell her
2021/01/28, 13:35 - Jhyan: Nvm
2021/01/28, 13:54 - Adela: no problem
2021/01/28, 18:41 - Jhyan: We both have the same problem with our beds directly behind where we work
2021/01/28, 18:48 - Adela: i made the mistake of falling asleep during first break and only waking up halfway into maths
2021/01/28, 18:49 - Jhyan: 😬
2021/01/28, 18:49 - Jhyan: I saw you weren't there
2021/01/28, 18:49 - Adela: did sir notice? 💀
2021/01/28, 18:49 - Adela: i joined at like 11:10
2021/01/28, 18:49 - Jhyan: Idk
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: If he took register we wouldn't have known
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: But he didn't say anything
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: And anyway if he did I doubt it would be bad
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Adela: i did his online register
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: They don't really take it as seriously with matrics
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Adela: no i’ve missed his lessons before, and i did catch up with the work already
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: Oh yeah so it's probably fine then
2021/01/28, 18:50 - Jhyan: Really
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Jhyan: This year?
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Adela: no last year
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Jhyan: Oh I see
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Adela: i fell asleep during ap this morning
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Adela: and i’m waiting for her to post the google meet so i can catch up
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Jhyan: Oh yeah but also you said you hate catching up work
2021/01/28, 18:51 - Adela: i do 🥴 but sometimes there is no other choice
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Jhyan: >I must sleep
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Adela: 😭😭😭
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Adela: exactly
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Adela: i really couldn’t control falling asleep during ap maths, i was beyond exhausted
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/28, 18:52 - Jhyan: I hate staying up before AP because I have to wake up early
2021/01/28, 22:19 - Jhyan: Do you know what the AP maths homework is?
2021/01/28, 22:20 - Jhyan: I know it's 2.3 but not whether it's all of it
2021/01/28, 22:20 - Jhyan: I'll just do all of it actually
2021/01/28, 23:29 - Adela: i think it is all of it, i wasn’t really in the meeting 💀
2021/01/28, 23:30 - Adela: im waiting for her to post the recording
2021/01/28, 23:30 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2021/01/28, 23:30 - Jhyan: I forgot lmao
2021/01/28, 23:30 - Jhyan: Well if you want you can also read the product and quotient rule from the textbook
2021/01/28, 23:31 - Jhyan: That's basically as useful as what she taught us
2021/01/28, 23:32 - Adela: yeah i’ll do that tomorrow, but thanks
2021/01/28, 23:32 - Jhyan: I didn't really do anything
2021/01/29, 18:20 - Jhyan: You must have enjoyed the rain this week 🌧️
2021/01/29, 18:30 - Adela: it was quite enjoyable 😂😂😂
2021/01/29, 18:30 - Adela: i prefer storms though and it wasn’t storming so much as constant showers
2021/01/29, 18:32 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/01/29, 18:32 - Jhyan: I didn't like how humid it became
2021/01/29, 18:36 - Jhyan: But the cold made up for it
2021/01/29, 18:36 - Jhyan: It's still far better than heat
2021/01/29, 18:48 - Adela: i’m kind of in betwene
2021/01/29, 18:48 - Adela: between*
2021/01/29, 18:48 - Adela: but the weather this week was decent
2021/01/29, 18:48 - Adela: i just wish there was lightning and thunder
2021/01/29, 18:49 - Jhyan: Yeah the sound is quite satisfying
2021/01/30, 01:12 - Jhyan: Good night 🌙
2021/01/30, 01:12 - Adela: good night jhyan 🤍
2021/01/30, 15:10 - Jhyan: I did it again but this time with the words "radiation" "radioactive" and "radio"
2021/01/30, 15:12 - Jhyan: Basically radio signal comes from radiation signal
2021/01/30, 15:14 - Jhyan: It seems obvious now so maybe it's not that interesting
2021/01/30, 19:33 - Adela: that’s such an interesting fact
2021/01/30, 19:33 - Adela: it is interesting !
2021/01/30, 19:33 - Jhyan: You know those times when you suddenly realise something but everybody was already aware of it
2021/01/30, 19:34 - Jhyan: I realised there was a possibility of would be one of those times, that's why I said that
2021/01/30, 20:16 - Adela: what page is the activity that we are supposed to do for IT?
2021/01/30, 20:16 - Adela: yes
2021/01/30, 20:16 - Adela: nah i didnt know it so perhaps i am the person 😂
2021/01/30, 20:29 - Jhyan: Do you still need the page
2021/01/30, 20:29 - Jhyan: I mean activity
2021/01/30, 20:30 - Adela: yes i do
2021/01/30, 20:30 - Jhyan: Are you sure we were supposed to do one
2021/01/30, 20:30 - Jhyan: Lemme check if I wrote it down
2021/01/30, 20:31 - Jhyan: I think she just wanted us to do the past papers
2021/01/30, 20:32 - Jhyan: Because we didn't finish last lesson's content
2021/01/30, 20:32 - Jhyan: But check with someone else just in case
2021/01/30, 20:51 - Adela: apparently activity 3, but i was confused because we haven’t done activity 2
2021/01/30, 21:53 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/01/30, 21:53 - Jhyan: Sorry for replying late
2021/01/30, 21:54 - Jhyan: It's possible that we skip activity 2
2021/01/30, 21:54 - Jhyan: Idk
2021/01/30, 23:56 - Adela: i’ll ask her abt it
2021/01/30, 23:56 - Adela: but thank you, jhyan
2021/01/30, 23:56 - Jhyan: Well I hope I helped
2021/01/31, 00:39 - Jhyan: Did you solve it?
2021/01/31, 01:08 - Jhyan: Is there a reason you capitalised my name here?
2021/01/31, 01:08 - Jhyan: I just randomly remembered it
2021/01/31, 01:08 - Adela: there was no reason, i sometimes just do it by default 😂
2021/01/31, 01:08 - Adela: like some people find not capitalising their name as disrespectful 💀
2021/01/31, 01:08 - Jhyan: Makes sense
2021/01/31, 01:09 - Adela: i’m going to speak to her tomorrow, i figured it was too late to do it now
2021/01/31, 01:09 - Jhyan: So you usually write in lowercase but you forget and accidentally do it right
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Jhyan: Did exercise 3 look really long
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Adela: 😂😂😂 yes
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Jhyan: Or tedious
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Adela: but like if i write formally then i put the capitals where they should ve
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Adela: be*
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Adela: it did
2021/01/31, 01:10 - Jhyan: Oh no
2021/01/31, 01:11 - Jhyan: That's gonna be annoying
2021/01/31, 01:12 - Jhyan: I kept having this thought at the back of my mind that I was forgetting some crucial work but I could never pin it down
2021/01/31, 01:20 - Jhyan: Are you coming back to school in person?
2021/01/31, 01:21 - Adela: i am indeed
2021/01/31, 01:21 - Adela: are you?
2021/01/31, 01:21 - Jhyan: Are you excited to?
2021/01/31, 01:21 - Adela: i have that feeling right now
2021/01/31, 01:21 - Jhyan: Yes
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Adela: but don’t forget to read the articles for the english discussion this week
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Jhyan: I often have it, but it was strong earlier today
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Adela: not excited, but i don’t enjoy online school, so i guess it’s a change that ill accept
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Jhyan: Oh yeah that's important
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Jhyan: Thank you
2021/01/31, 01:22 - Jhyan: Also I wouldn't have known about the IT homework without you
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Jhyan: I just want to wear the blue blazer
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Adela: yeah it is
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Jhyan: Also I'm getting tired of the government
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Adela: of course, no problem 🥺
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Adela: yeah me too, i’m going to wear mine 😂
2021/01/31, 01:24 - Adela: yes !
2021/01/31, 01:25 - Jhyan: I worked hard for it
2021/01/31, 01:25 - Jhyan: I was worried when I thought blazers were disallowed
2021/01/31, 01:54 - Jhyan: I'm gonna sleep now
2021/01/31, 01:54 - Jhyan: Good night
2021/01/31, 14:21 - Jhyan: I'm doing exercise 3 rn and it seems possible
2021/01/31, 14:21 - Jhyan: At least with my understanding
2021/01/31, 14:24 - Jhyan: Sifiso sent me videos that explain how DBMS works
2021/01/31, 14:24 - Jhyan: On normalisation
2021/01/31, 14:25 - Jhyan: He said it really helped him and tbh it clarified everything to me
2021/01/31, 14:25 - Jhyan: There's like 3 and they're all under 10 minutes
2021/01/31, 14:25 - Jhyan: Do you want them
2021/01/31, 14:26 - Jhyan: Because Ms. Mazibuko is really vague unless you know what questions to ask to clear up information
2021/01/31, 14:27 - Adela: yes please
2021/01/31, 14:27 - Adela: this is very true
2021/01/31, 14:27 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/jgUeOjImOOw
2021/01/31, 14:28 - Jhyan: That other two are easy to find with the first one
2021/01/31, 14:29 - Adela: thank you jhyan 🤍
2021/01/31, 14:29 - Jhyan: No problem
2021/01/31, 14:29 - Jhyan: I hope they help
2021/02/01, 17:40 - Jhyan: So how was day one of being at school
2021/02/01, 17:49 - Jhyan: Oh this is a cool one
2021/02/01, 17:50 - Jhyan: Like this
2021/02/01, 17:50 - Jhyan: But not about word origins
2021/02/01, 17:50 - Jhyan: There are certain mistakes that characterise the linguistic background of non-native English speakers
2021/02/01, 17:51 - Jhyan: For example, Russians often leave out "the", as they don't have an equivalent word. Afrikaans people confuse "is" and "are" because their word is the same for both ("is")
2021/02/01, 17:52 - Jhyan: I just recognised the patterns
2021/02/01, 17:52 - Jhyan: When I did some basic Russian on Duolingo I understood why that mistake was so easy for them to make
2021/02/01, 17:53 - Jhyan: Anyway I was reminded of it while reading the textbook, which is made by Afrikaans authors judging by the type of mistakes that are made
2021/02/01, 17:53 - Jhyan: The Business Studies one
2021/02/01, 18:17 - Adela: i didnt necessarily enjoy it, but i was less tired and i enjoyed being able to move around
2021/02/01, 18:17 - Adela: and for you?
2021/02/01, 18:17 - Jhyan: Yeah same
2021/02/01, 18:17 - Jhyan: It was easier to focus
2021/02/01, 18:18 - Adela: that’s actually really interesting, i’m sure there’s a bunch of data abt that because a lot of people who speak english don’t necessarily do it as a first language
2021/02/01, 18:18 - Jhyan: And I hated feeling like I was becoming one with my chair
2021/02/01, 18:18 - Jhyan: Yeah also related is there are certain mistakes made almost exclusively by native speakers
2021/02/01, 18:18 - Jhyan: I didn't figure this one out by myself, I read it somewhere
2021/02/01, 18:18 - Jhyan: But saying "would of" instead of "would have" for example
2021/02/01, 18:19 - Jhyan: You didn't wear your blue blazer
2021/02/01, 18:27 - Jhyan: Wait have you ever talked about SATs
2021/02/01, 18:36 - Adela: isn’t that american?
2021/02/01, 18:36 - Adela: yeah me too
2021/02/01, 18:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/01, 18:36 - Jhyan: I'm confused
2021/02/01, 18:36 - Adela: a very common mistake
2021/02/01, 18:37 - Jhyan: Basically my conversational memory is really bad sometimes; I've talked about this before
2021/02/01, 18:38 - Jhyan: But I also remember random details years later for no reason
2021/02/01, 18:39 - Jhyan: Anyway I just remembered (maybe incorrectly) that you said were going to take SATs this year long ago.

The problem is that that can't be right because you're going to UCT.
2021/02/01, 18:40 - Adela: yeah i don’t recall ever saying that??? maybe i did, but ive never really had an interest in studying in america
2021/02/01, 18:41 - Adela: perhaps the uk, but never america
2021/02/01, 18:41 - Jhyan: My memory is dying 😎
2021/02/01, 18:43 - Jhyan: Yeah same, it's actually pretty horrible there. The way they test things is really strange and they put pressure on students and also they're mega expensive
2021/02/01, 18:43 - Jhyan: Basically it's like their work culture but slightly better and slightly worse at the same time
2021/02/01, 18:46 - Jhyan: Oh actually there's a valid possibly explanation for this
2021/02/01, 18:46 - Jhyan: *possible
2021/02/01, 20:36 - Jhyan: What happened with your blazer
2021/02/01, 20:36 - Jhyan: You seemed excited to wear it
2021/02/01, 22:59 - Jhyan: I'll see you tomorrow
2021/02/01, 23:03 - Adela: i’m also just not a huge fan of america
2021/02/01, 23:03 - Adela: what is the reason?
2021/02/01, 23:03 - Adela: i decided to wear pants today and that went against the whole blazer thing because i hate wearing pants and the blazer 😂
2021/02/01, 23:04 - Jhyan: There's 3 that I identified after I said this actually
2021/02/01, 23:05 - Jhyan: That too
2021/02/01, 23:17 - Jhyan: 1. The transfer share of mental capability with technology, such as what Plato was worried about: losing memory strength with written word because people would rely on what was written, except with technology this time (I've talked about this one before)

2. Exams last year destroyed some of my recent memory because I was so stressed about them, tried to cram all the info and artificially valued them more as opposed to other stuff

Number 3 is about my depression and I don't have a problem sharing it but if you don't want to read it you don't have to
2021/02/01, 23:17 - Jhyan: 3a: Depression has been shown to impair memory, so I might have been losing it at the time and just not even noticing

3b: I might have hidden parts of the memory of those years and actually pretty much everything before that from myself subconsciously like in PTSD cases. I only remember things unfragmented from the start of 2019.
2021/02/01, 23:19 - Jhyan: The first one I thought immediately of was number 2
2021/02/01, 23:19 - Jhyan: But I've known about all of them for a while
2021/02/01, 23:22 - Jhyan: Do blazers look bad with pants?
2021/02/01, 23:22 - Adela: all of those reasons make perfect sense, i’ve heard quite a bit abt depression playing a huge role in one’s ability to remember things and sometimes we just block memories out because of a reason that we don’t even know- perhaps we forgot the reason along with the memories too
2021/02/01, 23:22 - Adela: well personally, i don’t like it on myself
2021/02/01, 23:23 - Jhyan: That's an interesting preference
2021/02/01, 23:24 - Jhyan: At the time whenever I saw the claims that it affects memory I would brush it off because I was able to get distinctions without even trying so I took that as proof that my memory was fine
2021/02/01, 23:28 - Jhyan: But now everything is disarrayed. I remember random memories sometimes. I have no concept of the chronological order of anything pre-2019. Sometimes when I look back at old conversations for whatever reason I find things I don't remember that I feel I should have, or find things that are whole years away from where I thought they were, or events that I thought were in A then B order but were actually in B then A order.
2021/02/01, 23:29 - Jhyan: And all of my earlier childhood included
2021/02/01, 23:29 - Jhyan: That's all I have to say about that
2021/02/01, 23:30 - Adela: i actually have the same thing going on, like a lot of memories i am able to access and stuff
2021/02/01, 23:31 - Adela: for me personally, it feels like a weird sense of identity that is almost gone
2021/02/01, 23:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/01, 23:31 - Adela: and i generally have a good memory
2021/02/01, 23:31 - Jhyan: I relate to this
2021/02/01, 23:32 - Jhyan: Is this related to that feeling that you were just a shell or a husk before last year
2021/02/01, 23:34 - Adela: yeah i suppose so, the year that’s the biggest blur to me is grade 8 because i think it was my most hectic year in terms of my emotional and mental state. i can’t really remember it that well, it’s just odd memories now and then. the only time from which i can remember is like end of 2019
2021/02/01, 23:37 - Adela: actually this isn’t entirely true because i can’t really remember last year either 😂
i spent like the whole of term 1 spiralling and using unhealthy methods to try and cope, term 2 was online which was a blur too, and then term 3 i was so stressed that i blocked out everything else
2021/02/01, 23:37 - Adela: so i guess we have some of the same reasons for not being able to remember parts of the past
2021/02/01, 23:37 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I don't remember last year either, but I can at least chalk that up to the monotony of the year
2021/02/01, 23:38 - Jhyan: When people do the same thing over and over again the memories don't stay
2021/02/01, 23:38 - Jhyan: Although I do remember being at school in term 3 and some things that happened then
2021/02/01, 23:40 - Adela: that’s true
2021/02/01, 23:40 - Jhyan: Term 2 was the worst at lacking variety so it would be the most amalgamated
2021/02/01, 23:40 - Adela: i do remember that
2021/02/01, 23:40 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense
2021/02/01, 23:41 - Jhyan: And you've found better coping mechanisms?
2021/02/01, 23:48 - Adela: yeah i did, lockdown kind of helped me
2021/02/01, 23:48 - Adela: basically i developed some sort of alcohol dependency on term 1 last year and then with lockdown, i was forced to actually confront things
2021/02/01, 23:48 - Jhyan: Apparently a lot of people were helped by it
2021/02/01, 23:49 - Jhyan: I'm glad you solved your situation
2021/02/01, 23:49 - Jhyan: I was too
2021/02/01, 23:50 - Jhyan: That's when my depression ended
2021/02/01, 23:52 - Jhyan: I don't have anything to say about the alcohol besides this. I've never drank more than a sip and haven't really been exposed to it so I wouldn't presume to know anything.
2021/02/01, 23:52 - Jhyan: Just because this seems kinda empty and vague but I do mean it
2021/02/01, 23:53 - Adela: thank you jhyan
2021/02/01, 23:53 - Jhyan: I was able to rewrite my identity into something I've accepted now.
2021/02/01, 23:54 - Adela: i’m still battling with my shit, i guess i didn’t really address it fully during lockdown, but i’m better
2021/02/01, 23:54 - Jhyan: 🤍
2021/02/01, 23:54 - Adela: yeah it’s kind of like a weird coping mechanism? because it makes you forget who you are or what’s on your mind and you become this totally different person
2021/02/01, 23:55 - Adela: and i guess it became this thing of trying to chase that feeling to escape having to acknowledge or even figure out who i really was
2021/02/01, 23:55 - Jhyan: Yeah the drug itself is classified as a depressant
2021/02/01, 23:55 - Adela: thats really good, i’m happy for you
2021/02/01, 23:55 - Jhyan: So what you're saying makes sense
2021/02/01, 23:56 - Jhyan: Like not as in it makes you depressed, just that it slows or dampens brain activity
2021/02/01, 23:56 - Jhyan: As opposed to like cocaine, which is a stimulant
2021/02/01, 23:56 - Jhyan: Ok that's an extreme example
2021/02/01, 23:56 - Jhyan: Maybe coffee is better
2021/02/01, 23:59 - Jhyan: Because it has that effect, it would be a compatible (but unhealthy) combatant to an identity crisis
2021/02/02, 00:00 - Adela: that’s quite strange actually, i never knew that
2021/02/02, 00:00 - Adela: i suppose thats why i started turning to it, but i stopped that 😂
2021/02/02, 00:01 - Jhyan: :)
2021/02/02, 00:03 - Jhyan: I know this is only tangential but the history of coffee is really interesting, it basically kick-started the scientific revolution and all modern scientific progress. Also consumption used to be a crime punishable by being tied in leather bags and thrown into the ocean because powerful entities were that scared of it.
2021/02/02, 00:09 - Jhyan: I think you'll be able to defeat your shit
2021/02/02, 00:13 - Jhyan: I don't know about you but it felt good to talk about it and relate to you. So thank you. I don't know what else to say now, so good night 🌙🌧️
2021/02/02, 06:26 - Adela: that is interesting. it’s so weird how something so mundane now was something so feared in the past
2021/02/02, 06:26 - Adela: thank you jhyan 🤍
2021/02/02, 06:26 - Adela: it did feel good to talk about it with you, so thank you for that.
i know it’s not the nighttime anymore, but thank you 🖤
2021/02/03, 12:32 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/zHL9GP_B30E

This relates to that discussion we had about memory in lockdown
2021/02/03, 12:32 - Jhyan: I just remembered it now when you said time goes faster during online school
2021/02/03, 12:32 - Jhyan: It explains why
2021/02/03, 15:14 - Jhyan: Have you been keeping up with all this asem work?
2021/02/03, 15:16 - Adela: i’ve been trying to, yes. she hasn’t explicitly been saying which chapters we should read though
2021/02/03, 15:16 - Jhyan: I just think there's a lot of stuff we're supposed to be doing
2021/02/03, 15:17 - Jhyan: She posted questions and chapter summaries of chapter 3 and 4 and it was due the day after, but then there were also past papers
2021/02/03, 15:17 - Jhyan: And the questions are multiple pages long
2021/02/03, 15:17 - Adela: i did those but not the past papers
2021/02/03, 15:17 - Adela: the past papers are in preparation for the test tomorrow
2021/02/03, 15:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/03, 15:18 - Adela: the work is more to just essentially write summaries abt the book
2021/02/03, 15:19 - Jhyan: How important do you think they are
2021/02/03, 15:20 - Adela: quite for your own sake because we are going to write exams on the book
2021/02/03, 15:23 - Jhyan: And you did all 3 pages of questions that require reference to the book in 1 afternoon?
2021/02/03, 15:23 - Adela: yhup 😭
2021/02/03, 15:47 - Jhyan: Oh they're actually not that bad
2021/02/03, 15:47 - Jhyan: The chapter 1 ones seemed much worse
2021/02/03, 15:48 - Jhyan: The only thing is having to look in the book for specific answers
2021/02/03, 17:28 - Jhyan: Pretyr Baelish is an INTJ
2021/02/03, 17:28 - Jhyan: Littlefinger
2021/02/03, 18:03 - Jhyan: She also posted duplicates so I thought it was way more than it was
2021/02/03, 18:03 - Adela: i just realised as well, turns out i have completed the work already because i did it yesterday
2021/02/03, 18:04 - Adela: oh no, idk if i like him 😭
2021/02/03, 18:04 - Jhyan: Eish
2021/02/03, 18:04 - Jhyan: Well the point is that he's supposed to be a cunning strategist right
2021/02/03, 18:05 - Jhyan: Even if the integrity of his character isn't something you would agree with
2021/02/03, 18:05 - Adela: yeah he is an amazing strategist
2021/02/03, 18:06 - Jhyan: How far are you in rewatching it
2021/02/03, 19:11 - Jhyan: There wasn't any AP maths homework right?
2021/02/03, 19:12 - Jhyan: I asked Sifiso yesterday and he said no but I just want to make sure
2021/02/03, 19:12 - Adela: not that i know of, no
2021/02/03, 19:16 - Jhyan: I swear I'm going to be paranoid that I've missed homework for decades
2021/02/03, 19:20 - Jhyan: What are you doing for your community service hours?
2021/02/03, 19:47 - Adela: i completed them already
2021/02/03, 19:47 - Adela: i just have constant stress now
2021/02/03, 20:03 - Jhyan: What did you do for them
2021/02/03, 20:24 - Adela: i did the pride flag initiative last year and another initiative last year, then all of the hours i helped out at school
2021/02/03, 20:24 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2021/02/03, 20:24 - Jhyan: I'm glad it's only 10 hours now
2021/02/03, 20:35 - Jhyan: Idk how you're doing this at the same time as school, the show is 62 hours long🕳️
2021/02/03, 20:36 - Adela: i’m not rewatching GOT, i’ve never watched it before 😂
2021/02/03, 20:36 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2021/02/03, 20:36 - Adela: but yeah i’m watching that and bridgerton somehow
2021/02/03, 20:36 - Jhyan: I just was thinking as if it were me
2021/02/03, 20:37 - Jhyan: Apparently when you're listening to speech a large part of the cognition is your brain imagining how you would speak those words and what words you would say next etc.
2021/02/03, 20:38 - Jhyan: Musicians listening to music have the areas of their brain that are active in playing it light up, but not people who don't know how to play music
2021/02/03, 20:48 - Adela: that’s actually so strange, i wonder if i constitute as a musician 😂
2021/02/03, 20:48 - Adela: i never knew that
2021/02/03, 21:10 - Jhyan: I'm trying to remember where I read it
2021/02/03, 21:10 - Jhyan: I think it might've been in a podcast but I'm not sure
2021/02/03, 21:11 - Jhyan: Idk but maybe because you know some piano
2021/02/03, 21:12 - Jhyan: I now I sometimes feel like playing music then I hear it. My fingers get the urge to press the keys of the notes I'm hearing
2021/02/03, 21:12 - Jhyan: *know
2021/02/03, 22:11 - Jhyan: I just finished the podcast episode on what reminded me of this
2021/02/03, 22:12 - Jhyan: There's a massive flaw in the LSAT and the entire legal industry in the US
2021/02/03, 22:12 - Jhyan: That's what it was about
2021/02/03, 22:22 - Jhyan: Basically the LSAT is designed in such a way that it forces students to speed through deep legal problems. This means that only students that can efficiently work at super high speeds (but not necessarily think deeply over a long time) are the ones that qualify for top law schools like Harvard etc.

The reason it's done like this is because those elite schools want to keep a limited amount of entries fixed instead of expanding. If the test was reconfigured to allow both speed efficiency levels to get their best potential marks, they wouldn't be able to just take a percentile because there wouldn't be enough of a difference in the top students. They would be forced to expand.

Furthermore, the top law positions _only_ consider top law school graduates while still requiring both speed categories of genius level students for their problems. When statistically analysed for correlations in success and other factors in students, the school _doesn't even matter_, no matter how high or low prestige they are.
2021/02/03, 22:26 - Jhyan: It actually hurts how there can still be such an obvious problem in the world. This is just one of them, Revisionist History explores more and you can imagine how they can be anywhere at any level in society. It's so easy to fix and there's basically nothing stopping a solution, and yet it still persists.
2021/02/03, 22:33 - Adela: that makes a lot of sense
2021/02/03, 22:33 - Adela: there are so many problems in the world and things are so segregated
2021/02/03, 22:34 - Jhyan: Yeah I mean obviously this problem is horrifying but at least it's not like dehumanizing or something like others
2021/02/03, 22:34 - Jhyan: But then, think about what this says about those ones
2021/02/03, 22:46 - Jhyan: If something this obvious can persist then what's stopping things that aren't as obvious
2021/02/03, 22:46 - Jhyan: There are probably things nobody even knows about yet
2021/02/03, 22:49 - Adela: yeah the juxtaposition is insane
2021/02/03, 23:06 - Jhyan: Have you filled in those subject registration forms
2021/02/03, 23:06 - Jhyan: Idk what to put for ID type because I only have a passport and in my passport it says "Type: PC"
2021/02/03, 23:07 - Jhyan: The example on the form is RSA and Botswana, but what if those specifically refer to ID cards
2021/02/03, 23:18 - Jhyan: Did you do it one by one for effect
2021/02/03, 23:19 - Jhyan: Or can you not select multiple at once
2021/02/04, 00:18 - Jhyan: Good night Adela 🌙
2021/02/04, 07:04 - Adela: i did
2021/02/04, 07:04 - Adela: i’m not really sure because i did the ID one
2021/02/04, 07:04 - Jhyan: They made it seem like if we got them wrong it would be over for us
2021/02/04, 07:04 - Adela: regardless of whether you have a physical copy or not, you should have an ID number
2021/02/04, 07:05 - Adela: i don’t think i can select multiple
2021/02/04, 07:05 - Jhyan: Thanks for the information
2021/02/04, 07:07 - Adela: you’re welcome even though i feel like i didn’t do much
2021/02/04, 16:34 - Jhyan: What are you doing this weekend?
2021/02/04, 17:10 - Adela: i have a driving lesson this weekend, but otherwise, i’m just going to focus on working
2021/02/04, 17:10 - Adela: and you?
2021/02/04, 17:12 - Jhyan: I don't usually do anything on weekends
2021/02/04, 17:18 - Jhyan: I was asking because I wanted to do something with you again, but you say you're working, which isn't a one-time event
2021/02/04, 17:23 - Jhyan: Honestly it's perfectly reasonable to want to focus on work. I wouldn't think of doing otherwise if not for certain circumstancial factors.
2021/02/04, 17:26 - Jhyan: Oh actually I did sign up for community service through hospice but they contact you when they need you so idk how certain that is of happening
2021/02/04, 17:46 - Jhyan: In hindsight, this seems like I'm already assuming you'll say no, but it was actually a way to let you know I don't mind if that's the case.
2021/02/04, 17:48 - Adela: i don’t think i’ll be able to this weekend, but what did you want to do?
2021/02/04, 17:48 - Jhyan: Well you've mentioned in the past that you eat with people
2021/02/04, 17:49 - Jhyan: That sounds so weird
2021/02/04, 17:49 - Jhyan: Anyway
2021/02/04, 17:49 - Jhyan: That was an option
2021/02/04, 17:49 - Jhyan: Like lunch
2021/02/04, 18:00 - Jhyan: I was anticipating that school would likely be a factor so I didn't really consider anything that would be very involved or time consuming.
2021/02/04, 18:09 - Jhyan: Ok this is unrelated but they spelled your name "Ardela" on the video
2021/02/04, 18:10 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/02/05, 07:35 - Adela: that would have been really lovely
2021/02/05, 07:35 - Adela: i know 😭, but he fixed it, thankfully
2021/02/05, 09:54 - Jhyan: Good luck
2021/02/05, 10:44 - Adela: thank you so much jhyan
2021/02/05, 14:13 - Jhyan: So what about next weekend then
2021/02/06, 12:48 - Adela: that could work, but ill let you know closer to the time because i still need to figure out how this week will go and the workload
2021/02/06, 12:49 - Jhyan: Of course
2021/02/06, 12:50 - Jhyan: School work is a volatile factor
2021/02/06, 22:39 - Jhyan: Did you do the driving lesson today
2021/02/06, 23:34 - Adela: i’m only doing a lesson tomorrow, so not yet
2021/02/06, 23:35 - Jhyan: Do you enjoy them
2021/02/06, 23:36 - Adela: i really love the lessons tbh
2021/02/06, 23:36 - Adela: but i’m scared it’s gonna be cancelled because it may rain and doing the parking and stuff won’t be ideal in those conditions
2021/02/06, 23:36 - Jhyan: That's not good
2021/02/06, 23:38 - Jhyan: I've only driven twice
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Jhyan: And both times I had to focus on doing basic stuff
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Adela: i feel like lessons help
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Jhyan: And you've said you've driven far before
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Adela: my very first lesson, my instructor put me on the road 💀
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Adela: i have driven quite far
2021/02/06, 23:39 - Adela: and like even gone on the freeway
2021/02/06, 23:40 - Jhyan: Wasn't that scary
2021/02/06, 23:40 - Adela: it was kinda scary but driving feels freeing to me
2021/02/06, 23:41 - Jhyan: Yeah I've always wondered what it feels like once it gets more automatic
2021/02/06, 23:50 - Jhyan: Sometimes video games design vehicles, especially non-traditional ones such as robotic mechs or something, really well and it creates this effect where it doesn't feel like a separate entity but rather an extension. It's trying to get close to how your body doesn't feel like a vehicle to your brain if I can describe it that way.

Even as I say this I doubt the value of this experience because it's not physical, but I've always wondered how it is with cars.
2021/02/06, 23:51 - Jhyan: Idk if I get the point across
2021/02/06, 23:59 - Jhyan: Anyway I hope it doesn't rain so you get to do it tomorrow
2021/02/07, 00:42 - Jhyan: Oh I just remembered something I wanted to ask you
2021/02/07, 00:43 - Jhyan: You were surprised that you got a distinction for AP maths
2021/02/07, 00:44 - Jhyan: So now that you have it and because you weren't expecting it, does it induce anxiety thinking you need to do it again?
2021/02/07, 00:44 - Adela: i’ve just been trying to complete the unfinished work i have from this week, sorry for replying sooner
2021/02/07, 00:44 - Jhyan: Don't worry about it 🔵
2021/02/07, 00:45 - Adela: cars are really interesting to drive, i suppose. it’s really strange and i just genuinely like feeling like i have control and i lack that feeling sometimes in my life so having that in a car is something that makes me happy momentarily for the time that i am driving
2021/02/07, 00:45 - Adela: thank you, i really hope so too
2021/02/07, 00:46 - Jhyan: I can relate to the lack of control thing
2021/02/07, 00:46 - Adela: i mean drizzle would be alright, but nothing more than that because i really don’t want my vision to be compromised - i don’t think i’ve reached the level where i can confidently drive in a full on thunderstorm
2021/02/07, 00:46 - Adela: it does sort of, but i also know that it may not be possible so i don’t want to push myself unreasonably because i would rather focus on the subjects that do matter, but no matter how many times i try to tell myself not to stress about ap maths, it always stresses me because i put this pressure on myself to exceed in everything i do
2021/02/07, 00:47 - Jhyan: That make sense. On the drive back to Johannesburg it was storming _and_ there was fog so thick you could barely see the car in front of you. I can only imagine how scary that is.
2021/02/07, 00:48 - Adela: yeah i’m really scared of driving in those conditions, like once on the way back from dullstroom, it was storming so hard that not even the windscreen wipers could keep up and we could literally see nothing except white
2021/02/07, 00:48 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/07, 00:49 - Jhyan: Maybe in the future self driving cars will take that away
2021/02/07, 00:50 - Jhyan: Actually that reminds me of this
2021/02/07, 01:04 - Jhyan: When I told Mr Marais that I was planning on being an actuary last year he became more serious and said "you have to get a distinction in AP Maths".

I don't know how seriously he meant that but it scared me, and now I'm even more scared because I got 55 for it last year because we didn't have time to study so I had to sacrifice it for other subjects.
2021/02/07, 01:10 - Adela: perhaps
2021/02/07, 01:10 - Adela: i don’t know if you necessarily will need a distinction because a lot of schools don’t offer ap maths and it’s not allowed to ever be a requirement for university applications
2021/02/07, 01:11 - Jhyan: Yeah I know but I think he was referring to the competitive nature of the entries
2021/02/07, 01:12 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2021/02/07, 01:13 - Jhyan: Lemme get the actual numbers before I make it seem like extreme hyperbole
2021/02/07, 01:25 - Jhyan: I can't find them
2021/02/07, 01:29 - Jhyan: I always feel guilty about deleting messages, but I basically just gave extreme figures that I vaguely remember that aren't likely to be correct
2021/02/07, 01:59 - Adela: don’t worry about it, jhyan
2021/02/07, 02:00 - Adela: i get you
2021/02/07, 02:02 - Jhyan: There are some threads that I can expand on but I don't think I'm going to stay up much longer
2021/02/07, 02:06 - Jhyan: And my mind is cluttered so it's taking way longer to formulate responses to their desired quality level
2021/02/07, 02:18 - Jhyan: Before I go to sleep, thank you for saying goodbye to me on Friday.
2021/02/07, 08:45 - Adela: no need to thank you me for that, i feel like it’s the bare minimum
2021/02/07, 20:56 - Jhyan: Have you done anything with the ORT yet?
2021/02/07, 20:56 - Jhyan: Because we haven't really been able to discuss what we're supposed to be doing
2021/02/07, 20:56 - Adela: not at all, but it hasn’t even been confirmed that we have one this year
2021/02/07, 20:57 - Jhyan: Oh
2021/02/07, 20:57 - Jhyan: Lmao
2021/02/07, 20:57 - Jhyan: I hope not
2021/02/07, 20:57 - Jhyan: Because I'm still not clear on exactly what the structure of it should be
2021/02/07, 20:58 - Jhyan: Mr. Colesky was like "Mr Bharuth will explain it to you all in RELO" and then Mr. Bharuth was like "your subject choice teacher will explain the specifics of what the task entails"
2021/02/07, 20:59 - Jhyan: And now Colesky is gone and I don't want to ask the new teacher
2021/02/07, 20:59 - Jhyan: Did you think of questions at all
2021/02/07, 21:00 - Jhyan: I guess not
2021/02/07, 21:00 - Jhyan: Based on your previous answer
2021/02/07, 21:18 - Jhyan: Have you watched The Big Short
2021/02/07, 22:22 - Adela: i kind of thought about a topic, but it’s not exactly concise
2021/02/07, 22:22 - Adela: i have never
2021/02/07, 22:22 - Jhyan: What was it
2021/02/07, 22:23 - Jhyan: It's basically a comedic depiction following a bunch of people who predicted the global financial crisis in 2008 and bet against it
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Jhyan: I just remembered it while doing the business worksheet
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Adela: it was about a business’s performance with/without women leadership
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Jhyan: It kinda gives off Wolf of Wallstreet vibes
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Adela: that’s crazy
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Jhyan: And if you haven't watched that, that's sad
2021/02/07, 22:24 - Adela: wolf of wall street is a really mad movie
2021/02/07, 22:25 - Jhyan: That's interesting
2021/02/07, 22:25 - Jhyan: I was gonna look at privatisation of the energy industry
2021/02/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: What are you doing rn
2021/02/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: Are you busy doing work
2021/02/08, 17:43 - Adela: yeah i’m trying to do the maths homework and then hopefully the ap
2021/02/08, 17:44 - Jhyan: The AP is easy it's just one question that we choose
2021/02/08, 17:44 - Jhyan: Ok I'll ask you later though
2021/02/08, 17:46 - Jhyan: You know I used to be able to read morse code
2021/02/08, 17:46 - Jhyan: I learnt it by myself in grade 8
2021/02/08, 17:46 - Jhyan: Idk why I'm telling you it just occurred to me
2021/02/08, 21:23 - Jhyan: I don't know how to ask this without the question biasing the answer itself
2021/02/08, 22:01 - Jhyan: Unrelated: 
are you okay? You were sleeping like 4 different times today
2021/02/08, 22:26 - Adela: i don’t know if i did enough, but i tried
2021/02/08, 22:27 - Adela: thats actually so cool... have you forgotten since?
2021/02/08, 22:27 - Adela: i’ve just been really tired, but thank you for checking 🤍
like idk i just didn’t sleep well last night at all
2021/02/08, 22:28 - Jhyan: Yeah I forgot
2021/02/08, 22:28 - Jhyan: Don't worry we're going to Mr Marais after school tomorrow
2021/02/08, 23:06 - Jhyan: I forgot about that app over the holidays so if you did too you must use it again
2021/02/08, 23:06 - Jhyan: You said it helped
2021/02/08, 23:06 - Jhyan: Sleep Cycle
2021/02/08, 23:07 - Adela: i really wanted to start using it again, but i’m scared the alarms won’t wake me up on time 😭
2021/02/08, 23:07 - Adela: because right now, i’m dealing with two simultaneous alarms from different devices so that i wake up
2021/02/08, 23:07 - Adela: i’m glad about that
2021/02/08, 23:08 - Jhyan: Try it with the upper limit before the time you want to wake up. The theory was that the timing of the waking up is worth more than the time slept, or at least significantly enough that it's possible that is outweighs the time slept in value if you're already sleeping low amounts
2021/02/08, 23:08 - Jhyan: I wouldn't be able to do a calculation because I don't have the data but you probably understand the concept
2021/02/08, 23:09 - Jhyan: So if you test it out for a few days and risk the possibility that you lose a few minutes of sleep, you might find that you're more energized even though you slept more
2021/02/08, 23:09 - Jhyan: *though you slept less
2021/02/08, 23:10 - Jhyan: Is it a matter of magnitude then
2021/02/08, 23:10 - Jhyan: If it is, then my argument might be invalid
2021/02/08, 23:11 - Jhyan: However, it could be that because it's aiming to wake you up when you're closest to lucidity, that you should be more susceptible to alarms at exactly when it would go off
2021/02/08, 23:11 - Jhyan: Idk
2021/02/08, 23:31 - Adela: apparently that was only a feature with premium but perhaps it does that regardless
2021/02/08, 23:32 - Adela: that’s true, i think i’ll try it tonight
2021/02/08, 23:32 - Jhyan: Really
2021/02/08, 23:32 - Jhyan: I can do it
2021/02/08, 23:32 - Adela: nah it was more like i kept oversleeping and it was like a shock factor
2021/02/08, 23:32 - Adela: i can also do it but idk if it chooses the best time for you and your sleep or if it just wakes you up randomly
2021/02/08, 23:33 - Jhyan: I don't think it would be random
2021/02/08, 23:33 - Jhyan: They need at least a small competitive advantage to be used instead of default alarms
2021/02/08, 23:34 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/02/08, 23:34 - Jhyan: It is included in the free version
2021/02/08, 23:35 - Adela: oh i see, i probably didn’t read it right then
2021/02/08, 23:35 - Jhyan: You can also change the window of time
2021/02/08, 23:36 - Jhyan: The only difference is that it's less likely you'll be at the peak of being close to lucidity
2021/02/08, 23:53 - Jhyan: Ok I'll just ask it with a variation of approach 2.

Would you say I'm weird?

And if so, is that a positive thing?

The way you understand the word weird in this context is very important. I mean it in the way that my behaviour is different enough to be viewed and treated differently socially, and I disregard all the negative connotation.

My aim is to collect data on myself that I can't derive from my own contemplation. I need this data in order to know how to improve and what improving means.

[I sound like a terms of service agreement rn lol]
2021/02/08, 23:56 - Jhyan: I understand that, ironically, this is a strange question to ask, but it's important.
2021/02/08, 23:57 - Jhyan: I'm gonna go to sleep but if you respond and I'm still awake I'll open it at least. I hope you sleep well this time
2021/02/08, 23:59 - Adela: i know of that, i did that but i didn’t realise it was waking me up when i was in a light sleep
2021/02/09, 00:01 - Adela: i wouldn’t say that you’re weird, i don’t think it’s the right adjective to use to describe somebody and if so, i think that everybody is weird in their own way.
like the minute that someone varies from what society wants a person to be, then their mannerisms are perceived as “weird”. i think you’re perhaps unusually quiet in usual circumstances, even though i obviously have had the pleasure of talking to you, but that doesn’t make a person weird, it just makes them reserved.
i personally think it’s much more respectable if someone doesn’t talk just for the sake of talking, but when they actually have something to say
2021/02/09, 00:02 - Jhyan: That's very helpful, thank you
2021/02/09, 00:03 - Jhyan: In fact, it addresses the reason main cause behind the question itself
2021/02/09, 00:09 - Adela: what do you mean?
2021/02/09, 00:09 - Jhyan: I was worried that I don't speak enough
2021/02/09, 00:10 - Jhyan: *~reason~
2021/02/09, 00:13 - Jhyan: Also I've been told that I sound disinterested or hostile because I struggle to sound more enthusiastic than neutral with trivialities like greeting people. I guess there's more to it, but that's not the point rn. When I talk to you at school, I hope it's never interpreted this way.
2021/02/09, 00:14 - Adela: i don’t think you should be because you do speak enough, you just don’t speak unless it’s necessary which isn’t a bad thing
2021/02/09, 00:14 - Adela: no, i never interpret it like that
2021/02/09, 00:14 - Jhyan: That's good
2021/02/09, 00:25 - Jhyan: Sleep well Adela 🌙
2021/02/09, 14:44 - Jhyan: Did you finish the business worksheet
2021/02/09, 14:44 - Adela: i did
2021/02/09, 14:57 - Jhyan: We're in Magadora's classroom
2021/02/09, 14:57 - Jhyan: Where we studied physics
2021/02/09, 14:58 - Jhyan: Just in case you didn't hear in class
2021/02/09, 14:58 - Adela: thank you 🤍
2021/02/09, 18:28 - Jhyan: What did you do for the second last question
2021/02/09, 18:29 - Jhyan: Because she doesn't say when the loan is compounded and it hadn't been a year since the date it started so it should be 0
2021/02/09, 18:29 - Jhyan: Actually we don't even know if it's compound or simple interest
2021/02/09, 18:41 - Adela: she said to assume it is simple
2021/02/09, 18:41 - Jhyan: But is it charged monthly
2021/02/09, 19:12 - Jhyan: Did you just assume it was monthly
2021/02/09, 19:12 - Jhyan: Because if it's yearly it's 0
2021/02/09, 19:14 - Adela: idk which question you’re referring to
2021/02/09, 19:14 - Adela: 7 or 6
2021/02/09, 19:14 - Jhyan: Q7 a
2021/02/09, 19:15 - Jhyan: Sorry I by serving last question I meant second last literal question, not question as in section
2021/02/09, 19:15 - Jhyan: *second
2021/02/09, 19:15 - Adela: it would be just a general 1% increase so it would become 18.5%
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Adela: that’s how i did it
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Jhyan: Why is that for 3 marks
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Jhyan: The calculation is literally 17.5 + 1
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Adela: generally all the questions have really high mark allocations, i don’t understand
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Jhyan: Yeah that's strange but anyway thanks
2021/02/09, 19:16 - Jhyan: I was stressing
2021/02/09, 19:18 - Jhyan: But then why does it phrase it like "interest accrued on the loan"
2021/02/09, 19:19 - Jhyan: I hope this isn't for real marks
2021/02/09, 19:19 - Adela: no i don’t think it is
2021/02/09, 19:20 - Adela: we were going to go through the answers together anyway
2021/02/09, 19:20 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2021/02/09, 19:26 - Jhyan: Are you studying for the short item rn
2021/02/09, 20:09 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/02/09, 20:15 - Adela: i don’t remember this 😭
2021/02/09, 20:15 - Adela: i am indeed
2021/02/09, 20:15 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/02/09, 20:15 - Jhyan: It's just AP so it's fine
2021/02/09, 20:15 - Jhyan: Remember to look at trig and stuff
2021/02/09, 20:16 - Jhyan: I forgot reduction formulae so I'm looking at those
2021/02/09, 20:16 - Adela: is trig in analytical?
2021/02/09, 20:16 - Jhyan: Nope but he said he can bring it in
2021/02/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: Because " it'S a sHoRt iTEm"
2021/02/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: Just not proofs or things that can't be applied to analytical
2021/02/09, 20:17 - Jhyan: So you won't get a question that only uses Euclidean geometry for example
2021/02/09, 20:18 - Jhyan: That's what I understood to his answer to with Aidan asked
2021/02/09, 20:21 - Adela: are there any proofs for analytical geometry anyway
2021/02/09, 20:21 - Jhyan: No
2021/02/09, 20:22 - Jhyan: I don't think so
2021/02/09, 20:22 - Jhyan: I vaguely remember someone asking in class and the answer was no
2021/02/09, 21:49 - Adela: oh thats good, at least
2021/02/10, 19:45 - Jhyan: So do we know if the physics test got moved to the 24th
2021/02/10, 19:45 - Jhyan: Like you suggested
2021/02/10, 19:46 - Jhyan: Sorry if it was said on the group I just don't want to sort through 250+ messages
2021/02/10, 20:10 - Adela: there were no objections and it seems to be on the 24th on the assessment timetable now
2021/02/10, 20:10 - Jhyan: That's good
2021/02/10, 20:11 - Jhyan: So it used to be on Monday?
2021/02/10, 20:11 - Adela: yeah it originally was
2021/02/10, 20:11 - Jhyan: Thanks for suggesting it
2021/02/10, 21:07 - Jhyan: Mr Marais' explanation of the rule was so much better
2021/02/10, 21:08 - Jhyan: I'm getting all the homework questions right first try
2021/02/10, 21:24 - Jhyan: I mean I guess that was true before, but not for all the questions and I was just following a procedure but I didn't really know why and had no grasp on how to remember it
2021/02/10, 21:25 - Jhyan: With his analogy with the core of a present it makes sense and I know when I'm done
2021/02/10, 21:25 - Jhyan: I was doubtful of whether I had fully applied the rule before but now I know when I get to x it's done
2021/02/10, 22:11 - Adela: it was a lot better
2021/02/10, 22:11 - Adela: i’m really glad you’ve gotten it
2021/02/10, 22:12 - Jhyan: What do you do when you're stressed
2021/02/10, 23:00 - Adela: i normally just try to prioritise and get the stuff down
2021/02/10, 23:00 - Adela: done*
2021/02/10, 23:00 - Adela: i pretty much live in a state of constant stress
2021/02/10, 23:00 - Jhyan: Don't you hate that
2021/02/10, 23:01 - Adela: indeed i do
2021/02/10, 23:01 - Jhyan: I never used to stress
2021/02/10, 23:01 - Jhyan: Before last year
2021/02/10, 23:01 - Jhyan: Well at least academically
2021/02/10, 23:01 - Jhyan: And now suddenly I stress and I don't know what to do
2021/02/10, 23:12 - Jhyan: Just as to why I'm asking you
2021/02/10, 23:21 - Adela: i also didn’t really stress
2021/02/10, 23:21 - Adela: i guess the pressure is bad now
2021/02/10, 23:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/10, 23:23 - Jhyan: Too bad stress actually does the opposite of helping me
2021/02/11, 00:01 - Jhyan: Good night, I hope we both find a way to deal with stress (definitely not what I wrote on the LO poster, I made all of that up 🙃)
2021/02/11, 00:05 - Adela: i haven’t even started that 😭
2021/02/11, 00:05 - Adela: but good night, jhyan🤍
2021/02/11, 00:06 - Jhyan: :)
2021/02/11, 15:36 - Jhyan: How's the weekend looking for you?
2021/02/11, 15:37 - Adela: well i have plans on sunday and unfortunately it’s looking worse than last week with all the IT pat and the english task 😭
2021/02/11, 15:45 - Jhyan: That's cool. Maybe we can do it next weekend or during midterm if the assessment timetable doesn't change. It doesn't look like there's a lot of stuff during the weeks following those
2021/02/11, 15:57 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I was looking at the assessment timetable to see where there wasn't that much work and I saw next week 😬
2021/02/11, 15:57 - Jhyan: This is probably a good idea
2021/02/11, 15:58 - Jhyan: 🔵
2021/02/11, 16:42 - Adela: i don’t think next week is that bad but i think it’s just the exhaustion of this week which is compounding everything and the fact that i have so many things i was unable to do during this week because of other priorities
2021/02/11, 16:42 - Adela: that works
2021/02/11, 16:43 - Jhyan: We have like 5 assessments
2021/02/11, 16:43 - Jhyan: But I get the stress thing
2021/02/11, 16:44 - Jhyan: This week forced me to put off a bunch of work that I now have to do
2021/02/11, 16:44 - Jhyan: Also I really thought I did horribly on the analytical geometry test
2021/02/11, 16:45 - Jhyan: So I can imagine the compound stress is similar for you
2021/02/11, 16:48 - Adela: english and maths?
2021/02/11, 16:48 - Adela: i don’t know of others?
2021/02/11, 16:48 - Jhyan: Yeah but they're not tests
2021/02/11, 16:48 - Adela: me too
2021/02/11, 16:49 - Jhyan: We have IT, a non-study FAL poetry test, and a business class task
2021/02/11, 16:49 - Jhyan: Also non study
2021/02/11, 16:49 - Jhyan: When I say assessments I meant things for marks
2021/02/11, 20:01 - Adela: i’m not too worried about the things we don’t have to study for and i’ve kinda moved on with assessments so far
2021/02/11, 20:09 - Jhyan: Oh wait
2021/02/11, 20:09 - Jhyan: I think we do have to study for the poetry test
2021/02/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2021/02/11, 20:11 - Jhyan: Turns out I mixed things up
2021/02/11, 20:12 - Jhyan: The poetry test is the week after but I switched it with the normalisation test
2021/02/11, 20:15 - Adela: oh crap the normalisation one
2021/02/11, 20:16 - Adela: poetry is not that hectic
2021/02/11, 20:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2021/02/11, 20:16 - Jhyan: Sorry I just probably confused you
2021/02/11, 20:17 - Adela: no it’s absolutely fine 😂
2021/02/11, 21:13 - Jhyan: What do you think about this whole form thing
2021/02/11, 21:23 - Adela: i think it’s a cool idea with the circumstances but has to be monitored properly
2021/02/11, 21:24 - Jhyan: I think it was a good idea for the time constraints we had
2021/02/11, 21:25 - Adela: yeah there wasn’t much for us to do in this time and we didn’t have time to rehearse or anything
2021/02/11, 23:17 - Jhyan: What does the actuarial part of your degree do
2021/02/11, 23:17 - Jhyan: Is it just for extra skills or does it look good to employees or something
2021/02/11, 23:18 - Jhyan: What's the benefit of it
2021/02/11, 23:18 - Adela: i think it’s both 😂
2021/02/11, 23:18 - Adela: but like you do the basic acturial science stuffs
2021/02/11, 23:19 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I guess now that I think about it there are risk related fields that aren't actual actuaries
2021/02/11, 23:21 - Jhyan: Because the completely actuarial focused one is structured similarly to a degree in medicine. They make you do internships and then write international exams to be allowed to practice.
2021/02/11, 23:59 - Adela: yeah there are
2021/02/11, 23:59 - Adela: yeah i’m not doing all of that, just business science really with exposure to actuarial science
