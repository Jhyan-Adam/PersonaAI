2017/03/31, 20:54 - Neo: The dumbest thing happened today
2017/03/31, 20:54 - Jhyan: What
2017/03/31, 21:07 - Jhyan: Wow
2017/03/31, 21:33 - Jhyan: Lol I'm downloading breath of the wild
2017/03/31, 21:33 - Jhyan: So my internet is slow AF
2017/03/31, 21:34 - Neo: Zelda???
2017/03/31, 21:34 - Neo: On the switch
2017/03/31, 21:34 - Jhyan: Nope
2017/03/31, 21:34 - Jhyan: I can emulate it on PC
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Neo: Switch emulator????
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Neo: For real???? already???
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Jhyan: It's not really an emulator
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Neo: What is it
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Jhyan: Because it only works for one game
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Neo: Oh
2017/03/31, 21:35 - Jhyan: I'll send you the link to download
2017/03/31, 21:36 - Neo: A switch emulator
2017/03/31, 21:36 - Neo: Shit
2017/03/31, 21:36 - Neo: I should test it out though
2017/03/31, 21:36 - Jhyan: http://igg-games.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-free-download.html
2017/03/31, 21:37 - Jhyan: It only emulates the game engine of Zelda, not the entire switch
2017/03/31, 21:37 - Jhyan: I was surprised to find it here though
2017/03/31, 21:37 - Jhyan: On this site
2017/03/31, 21:42 - Neo: Does it work for androi
2017/03/31, 21:43 - Jhyan: No
2017/03/31, 21:43 - Neo: Thought so
2017/03/31, 21:43 - Jhyan: It's too much for a phone to handle
2017/03/31, 21:44 - Neo: I don't want to go through the whole "Dad can i borrow your laptop" thing again
2017/03/31, 21:44 - Neo: Already did it for the 3ds emulator
2017/03/31, 21:44 - Jhyan: Again?
2017/03/31, 21:44 - Jhyan: What happened last fine
2017/03/31, 21:44 - Jhyan: *time
2017/03/31, 21:45 - Neo: Got Pokémon on the pc
2017/03/31, 21:46 - Neo: And i talked a lot for it
2017/03/31, 21:46 - Jhyan: Was he angry
2017/03/31, 21:46 - Jhyan: I think you should get a laptop. Like maybe with a 980 and a i5
2017/03/31, 21:46 - Neo: No
2017/03/31, 21:47 - Neo: Id prefer a pc
2017/03/31, 21:47 - Neo: But i will get a laptop
2017/03/31, 21:47 - Jhyan: Yeah but will your parents buy that?
2017/03/31, 21:47 - Jhyan: A laptop is the way to go for now at least
2017/03/31, 21:47 - Neo: As soon as my mom gets a job
2017/03/31, 21:48 - Jhyan: Yeah but rather get a desktop pc
2017/03/31, 21:48 - Neo: She already promised a 4k TV + Ps4 pro
2017/03/31, 21:48 - Jhyan: It's so much more worth it
2017/03/31, 21:48 - Neo: Idk 
4K>1080
2017/03/31, 21:49 - Jhyan: You can upgrade it when it gets old (which takes long since usually you can still turn down graphics settings)
2017/03/31, 21:49 - Jhyan: Also that's not real 4k
2017/03/31, 21:49 - Jhyan: It's upscaled
2017/03/31, 21:50 - Neo: ?
2017/03/31, 21:51 - Jhyan: Basically they just expand a 730p or in some cases a 1080p game to 4k
2017/03/31, 21:51 - Jhyan: Which doesn't do a whole lot besides making the picture 1080p on more pixels
2017/03/31, 21:52 - Jhyan: on PC you can play the old games or the new games (like you can't play uncharted 4 on a PS3)
2017/03/31, 21:52 - Jhyan: There are no generation limits
2017/03/31, 21:52 - Neo: Oh yeah
2017/03/31, 21:52 - Neo: Ik what you mean
2017/03/31, 21:52 - Neo: Lmao Ps4 emulator on the ps3
2017/03/31, 21:53 - Jhyan: But you can't get emulators on console
2017/03/31, 21:53 - Jhyan: And it would kinda be too much for the PS3 to handle PS4 games
2017/03/31, 21:54 - Neo: Idk the thought just came to me
2017/03/31, 21:54 - Neo: PS4 ROMs*
2017/03/31, 21:55 - Jhyan: even if your PC gets too old to play games at low settings there are still indie games (the final station is one, it's pixelated, is on my top 10 best games and rubs on a potato)
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Jhyan: Pc has so many more games
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Neo: Lol okay
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Jhyan: Anyway just saying you can get a PS4 pro if you want
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Jhyan: Or a PC which is better
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Neo: So you'd trade your PS4 for a top notch PC
2017/03/31, 21:56 - Jhyan: But obviously I can't force you
2017/03/31, 21:57 - Neo: Yeah
2017/03/31, 21:57 - Jhyan: And yes I would, but 6000 doesn't really get you a good pc
2017/03/31, 21:57 - Jhyan: That's the only problem, the price
2017/03/31, 21:57 - Jhyan: PC's are expensive, but BOI are they with it
2017/03/31, 21:58 - Neo: Trade not sell and buy
2017/03/31, 21:58 - Jhyan: Anyway I don't mind whether you get either one
2017/03/31, 21:58 - Neo: I'm gonna be soo nooby because of the controls
2017/03/31, 21:58 - Jhyan: Yeah but anyone who has a good PC wouldn't trade it in for a PS4
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: But the controls are easy
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: W
ASD
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: Arrow keys
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: W is up
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: A is left
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Jhyan: S is back
2017/03/31, 21:59 - Neo: Gaming is like learning languages
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Jhyan: D is right
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Neo: If you learn Latin it's gonna be easier to learn Latin based languages right
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Jhyan: And some games have extra controls like E to use
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Neo: Just like the PC if you play PC before you start playing PlayStation or Xbox it's gonna be much easier
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Jhyan: Yes it will be
2017/03/31, 22:00 - Jhyan: Yes
2017/03/31, 22:01 - Neo: Ok i adapt quite quickly so it's not a problem
2017/03/31, 22:01 - Jhyan: And shift to sneak or crouch
2017/03/31, 22:01 - Jhyan: But you will get used to it
2017/03/31, 22:01 - Neo: Ik relax I'm pretty sure games have tutorials
2017/03/31, 22:01 - Jhyan: It only took me like a year and I was young and hasn't played anything else besides the wii
2017/03/31, 22:02 - Jhyan: (Which is it's own controller language)
2017/03/31, 22:02 - Neo: Yess
2017/03/31, 22:02 - Neo: Like a German based language
2017/03/31, 22:02 - Jhyan: Yeah but tutorials don't get your hand used to what to do, just what to press
2017/03/31, 22:02 - Neo: Remember that game with the "Pokémon"
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Jhyan: Ohhhhh
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Neo: Like a fire chimp and something else
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Jhyan: Memories
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Jhyan: Spectrobes: origins
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Jhyan: It was so good
2017/03/31, 22:03 - Neo: Jeez
2017/03/31, 22:04 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/03/31, 22:05 - Jhyan: But anyway
2017/03/31, 22:05 - Neo: The graphics were godly back in the day
2017/03/31, 22:05 - Neo: Now they just trash
2017/03/31, 22:06 - Jhyan: Yeah
2017/03/31, 22:06 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2017/03/31, 22:06 - Neo: Soon the same thing is gonna happen to zero horizon and the Witcher 3
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Jhyan: Not really
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Neo: Lol yeah
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Neo: Yes
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Jhyan: We've reached a standstill
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Neo: It's gonna happen
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Neo: Not for long
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Jhyan: The good hands are photorealistic
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Jhyan: *games
2017/03/31, 22:07 - Neo: After we reach 8K (which they're pretty close to) it's gonna drop
2017/03/31, 22:08 - Jhyan: Yeah but the graphics will still be the same
2017/03/31, 22:08 - Jhyan: The models won't change, the lighting won't change, only the texture
2017/03/31, 22:08 - Jhyan: Which we won't notice so much
2017/03/31, 22:08 - Neo: No you know they've already taken an 8K picture
2017/03/31, 22:09 - Neo: The zoom on the picture was too much
2017/03/31, 22:09 - Jhyan: It's like in CIA
2017/03/31, 22:09 - Jhyan: When they're like "enhance"
2017/03/31, 22:10 - Jhyan: And the zoomed-in pixelated bullshit becomes HD
2017/03/31, 22:11 - Jhyan: Like, a camera from Jupiter can see the serial number on a phone off a bicyle mirror
2017/03/31, 22:11 - Jhyan: UNDERWATER
2017/03/31, 22:12 - Neo: Yes
2017/03/31, 22:12 - Neo: Shiit
2017/03/31, 22:12 - Jhyan: Shït
2017/03/31, 22:13 - Jhyan: ßhït
2017/03/31, 22:14 - Jhyan: Dude it's late
2017/03/31, 22:14 - Jhyan: Good night
2017/03/31, 22:15 - Neo: I'm still awake
2017/03/31, 22:15 - Neo: Wide awake
2017/04/01, 08:15 - Jhyan: Whaaaaaaazzzzzaaaaaaap?
2017/04/01, 08:15 - Neo: What time should we vome
2017/04/01, 08:15 - Jhyan: Idk what time you should vomit
2017/04/01, 08:16 - Neo: My mom wants to do this boring thing and if we do it were only be able to come at five
2017/04/01, 08:16 - Jhyan: Maybe when you eat something bad?
2017/04/01, 08:16 - Jhyan: 5?
2017/04/01, 08:16 - Neo: Yeah
2017/04/01, 08:17 - Jhyan: I thought you were gonna come at 3
2017/04/01, 08:17 - Neo: Idj
2017/04/01, 08:17 - Neo: I don't think so
2017/04/01, 08:18 - Jhyan: Shit
2017/04/01, 08:19 - Neo: Yeah
2017/04/01, 08:19 - Jhyan: Well you can't come until about 11 or 12
2017/04/01, 08:20 - Neo: Lmao so mom lied to me
2017/04/01, 08:20 - Jhyan: Nvm
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Jhyan: You can come to my dad now
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Neo: Wait when are you available
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Jhyan: If your mom is okay with them coming to my dad's house
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Jhyan: I'm available now
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Neo: Lol too early
2017/04/01, 08:21 - Jhyan: But lemme just get him to phone her
2017/04/01, 08:22 - Jhyan: Oh
2017/04/01, 08:22 - Neo: Okay
2017/04/01, 08:25 - Jhyan: Can you come at 12 without any problems
2017/04/01, 08:25 - Neo: Lemme ask
2017/04/01, 08:25 - Jhyan: Ok
2017/04/01, 08:26 - Jhyan: Otherwise come now
2017/04/01, 08:27 - Jhyan: Ok if you can come now then come now
2017/04/01, 08:28 - Jhyan: My dad will phone your mom
2017/04/01, 08:30 - Jhyan: Ok you can come later then
2017/04/01, 08:31 - Jhyan: This was so complicated
2017/04/01, 08:36 - Jhyan: Ok so just come around 12
2017/04/01, 08:36 - Jhyan: Final plan
2017/04/01, 08:36 - Jhyan: Jeez
2017/04/01, 08:38 - Neo: My mom said your dad is fetching us now
2017/04/01, 08:38 - Jhyan: Really
2017/04/01, 08:38 - Jhyan: Ok then
2017/04/01, 08:38 - Neo: Yeah
2017/04/01, 08:39 - Jhyan: I thought he didn't want to
2017/04/01, 08:39 - Jhyan: But ok then that's fine
2017/04/01, 08:40 - Jhyan: Wait
2017/04/01, 08:40 - Jhyan: My dad just said you're gonna come via uber
2017/04/01, 08:40 - Jhyan: And your mom said that
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Jhyan: Idk man

2017/04/01, 08:41 - Neo: Okay we coming with uber
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Jhyan: SO COMPLICATED
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Neo: My mom just told me
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Jhyan: Yep
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Neo: I need the address
2017/04/01, 08:41 - Jhyan: 3 Gerard street
2017/04/01, 08:42 - Jhyan: Observatory
2017/04/01, 08:43 - Jhyan: See you later
2017/04/01, 08:44 - Neo: Sure

2017/04/01, 08:50 - Neo: Okay
2017/04/01, 08:50 - Jhyan: There was a car outside
2017/04/01, 08:50 - Jhyan: We thought it was you
2017/04/01, 08:50 - Jhyan: Turns out it was just the NSA spying on us
2017/04/01, 08:50 - Jhyan: Jk
2017/04/01, 08:51 - Jhyan: It was a guy turning around
2017/04/01, 08:51 - Neo: Ok
2017/04/01, 08:52 - Neo: Should i bring a game or controller
2017/04/01, 08:53 - Jhyan: Nope I don't have anything here

2017/04/15, 08:37 - Jhyan: Lol
2017/04/15, 08:37 - Jhyan: I'm using my mom's internet via Bluetooth
2017/04/15, 08:38 - Neo: Lol
2017/04/15, 08:39 - Jhyan: She gets like 50gb of data each month
2017/04/15, 08:40 - Jhyan: She only has 9 left coz she was watching Netflix on her phone by accident
2017/04/15, 08:40 - Jhyan: But with data
2017/04/15, 08:48 - Neo: How do you accidentally do that
2017/04/15, 08:49 - Jhyan: By leaving data on and not having smart network switch enabled?
2017/04/15, 08:50 - Neo: Smart network switch is a waste of timw
2017/04/15, 08:50 - Jhyan: And then thinking you're on WiFi and deciding to watch the next episode of house of cards
2017/04/15, 08:50 - Jhyan: Why
2017/04/15, 08:50 - Neo: How do you forget to connect to the wifi
2017/04/15, 08:51 - Jhyan: Because you had data on and WiFi was off for some reason
2017/04/15, 08:51 - Jhyan: So it doesn't automatically connect

2017/11/14, 06:17 - Neo: Yeah
2017/11/14, 06:17 - Neo: Also because the keyboards original intention wasn't meant to be a controller for gaming
2017/11/14, 06:17 - Jhyan: Well now it is
2017/11/14, 06:18 - Jhyan: It feels like more control with a keyboard though
2017/11/14, 06:18 - Neo: So much control
2017/11/14, 06:18 - Jhyan: Also a mouse
2017/11/14, 06:19 - Neo: Just wrapping your fingers all around the conyroller
2017/11/14, 06:19 - Jhyan: You can't beat that with a controller in an FPS

2018/01/03, 18:30 - Jhyan: HOW DO YOU GET THE 1
2018/01/03, 18:39 - Neo: Totally pathetic, unreliable.

Known throughout the world for being super weak.

Maybe in ancient times it was really strong.

That’s what the rumours say, but they’re probably wrong.

But now it’s so weak, the weakest in the land.

So weak that’s it’s sad, really really sad.

The weak Pokémon, that’s you Magikarp.

But though you are the weakest, still you’ve won my heart

Oh, weak Pokémon, my love for you is strong.

Honestly it’s magical you’ve survived this long.

 

All it does it jump and splash, jump and splash around.

It splashes up whole mountains and all the way back down.

Why jump? What’s the point when nobody cares?

It uses Splash in battle.

Nothing happens.

Jumping and splashing every single day.

Until Pidgeotto…

Carries it away.

 

The jumping Pokemon, that’s you, Magikarp.

Although your moves are pointless, still you’ve won my heart.

Oh, splashing Pokemon, my love for you is strong.

Honestly it’s magical you’ve survived this long.

 

Wherever you go fishing, it’s the first you’ll catch.

Even with an Old Rod, you’ll soon have quite a batch.

Cast off in a river, or a puddle, or the sea.

Anywhere your hook is, Magikarp will be.

The slightest current will carry it away.

Anyplace the river bends…

That’s where they all stay.

 

A nibble on the line…

That’s you Magikarp.

Right back in you go, because you’ve won my heart.

Thought I caught a bite…

But it’s Magikarp.

I could never eat you…

Because you’ve won my heart.

 

It’s Shiny form sparkles golden in the light.

But don’t be deceived.

It’s still Magikarp inside.

Evolving into Gyarados makes it super strong.

Waiting to reach that level takes way too long.

Did you just buy one at the store yesterday?

“Sorry there’s no refund. Please go away.”

 

The pity Pokémon,  that’s you Magikarp.

Although they think you’re worthless…

Still you’ve won my heart.

The pity Pokémon, Magikarp it’s true.

At least you’re lowly ranking…

means nothing to you.

Beloved Pokémon, that’s you Magikarp.

Somehow you’ve turned weakness into a kind of art.

You’re my Pokémon, Magikarp my dream…

six matching Magikarp, that’ll be my team.

Beloved Pokémon, that’s you Magikarp.

Magical and special, of course you’ve won my heart.

The greatest Pokémon, Magikarp, it’s true.

And that’s why I’ve written this love song just for you!

2018/03/02, 21:30 - Neo: But you don't
2018/03/02, 21:30 - Neo: Why?
2018/03/02, 21:30 - Neo: Because you can't

2018/03/20, 20:15 - Jhyan: You can compare a game to another game
2018/03/20, 20:15 - Neo: No

2018/03/20, 20:15 - Jhyan: Plus it's not that is free

2018/03/20, 20:16 - Neo: Fornite only has 1 map
2018/03/20, 20:16 - Jhyan: Dying over and over again because I'm not good at defeating people in those situations is not fun
2018/03/20, 20:16 - Jhyan: I'd much rather snipe people from afar
2018/03/20, 20:17 - Jhyan: Or have a standoff from like 50m away
2018/03/20, 20:17 - Neo: Wow
2018/03/20, 20:17 - Neo: Gay
2018/03/20, 20:18 - Neo: U have a lame taste in games

2018/03/20, 20:18 - Neo: All of them
2018/03/20, 20:19 - Jhyan: Wow
2018/03/20, 20:19 - Neo: What's your favourite game
2018/03/20, 20:19 - Jhyan: Because The Witcher III is lame
2018/03/20, 20:19 - Neo: That's your favourite game?
2018/03/20, 20:19 - Jhyan: That I've played if Dying Light
2018/03/20, 20:20 - Neo: What
2018/03/20, 20:20 - Neo: Your favourite game came out 4 years ago
2018/03/20, 20:21 - Jhyan: World renowned, 8.5/10, excellent graphics for like 2014, great adaption to the zombie genre, great parkour, amazing story, good developers, etc etc
2018/03/20, 20:21 - Neo: Days gone
2018/03/20, 20:21 - Jhyan: Some people's favourite game is Portal 2
2018/03/20, 20:21 - Neo: Looks great
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Neo: Yeah that was a good game
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Neo: If you're in 7th grade lol
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Jhyan: Not the same thing, they only share the fact that they have zombies and that they're open world
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Neo: Lore of that game was great
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Jhyan: ?
2018/03/20, 20:22 - Jhyan: Why
2018/03/20, 20:23 - Jhyan: Anyway that is not my favourite game
2018/03/20, 20:26 - Jhyan: I don't have one because Limbo, Arkham Knight, The Witness, Jazzpunk, Please Don't Touch Anything, and The Final Station are all impossible to decide from
2018/03/20, 20:26 - Jhyan: Including Dying Light of course
2018/03/20, 20:29 - Jhyan: And it's not the same type of open world, aswell as the fact that Days Gone is more of a shooter because you basically don't use guns in Dying Light. Days Gone also has nothing to do with parkour. I could go on
2018/03/20, 20:32 - Neo: Ok
2018/03/20, 20:32 - Neo: LAME!
2018/03/20, 20:32 - Jhyan: Why
2018/03/20, 20:32 - Jhyan: You have no solid reason

2018/03/20, 20:33 - Neo: Sad boy

2018/03/20, 20:34 - Neo: Y
2018/03/20, 20:35 - Neo: Ok
2018/03/20, 20:36 - Jhyan: Because I'm not an idiot, I've been raised well, and I can make good desicions. I also have no need to indulge in such infernal and petty activities.
2018/03/20, 20:39 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/03/20, 20:40 - Jhyan: I sound like one of those fanatical, cringy Rick and Morty fans
2018/03/20, 22:02 - Neo: You are
2018/03/20, 22:02 - Neo: Lmao
2018/03/20, 22:21 - Jhyan: Dude look up unspoilme

2018/03/20, 22:22 - Neo: What
2018/03/20, 22:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/03/20, 22:22 - Jhyan: The future is now young man

2018/03/20, 22:22 - Neo: How
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Neo: Nigga gonna forget everything
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Jhyan: What's my name??!?!!?!?
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Jhyan: Nah that would be extremely damaging for Samsung
2018/03/20, 22:23 - Jhyan: So
2018/03/20, 22:24 - Neo: Not if you don't remember
2018/03/20, 22:24 - Jhyan: Hmm...
2018/03/20, 22:25 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/03/20, 22:25 - Neo: Bumass
2018/03/20, 22:25 - Jhyan: Yeah well fuck off
2018/03/20, 22:26 - Jhyan: That's probably so that if anything happens happens to a child Samsung won't be liable
2018/03/20, 22:27 - Jhyan: More legal than medical
2018/03/20, 22:27 - Neo: Yeah. You

2018/03/25, 02:47 - Neo: Yeah
2018/03/25, 10:15 - Jhyan: It's a violation of the "i" before "e" except after "c" rule

2018/04/02, 17:05 - Neo: What was it
2018/04/02, 17:06 - Jhyan: Just because it's been delayed it doesn't mean I can suddenly tell you

2018/04/03, 11:00 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/04, 07:17 - Jhyan: My mom said that she can't invite you this weekend
2018/04/04, 07:17 - Jhyan: Coz she's out doing horseriding stuff the whole time
2018/04/04, 07:32 - Neo: Ok
2018/04/04, 07:32 - Jhyan: 🤤
2018/04/04, 07:32 - Neo: What

2018/04/04, 09:14 - Neo: Okay I'll try
2018/04/04, 15:20 - Neo: We have a wedding so I couldn't have to your house if I could
2018/04/04, 16:39 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/05, 16:48 - Neo: Wtf
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Jhyan: Did you listen
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Jhyan: To the sound
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Neo: Yeah yeha
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Neo: Lol
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Neo: What's wrong with your dog
2018/04/05, 16:49 - Jhyan: She does that when you leave her after she rolls over
2018/04/05, 16:50 - Neo: What
2018/04/05, 16:50 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/05, 16:50 - Jhyan: You know how dogs roll over
2018/04/05, 16:51 - Jhyan: If you don't pat her while she's like that she starts doing that
2018/04/05, 16:51 - Neo: By themselves
2018/04/05, 16:51 - Neo: Oh her back is itchy
2018/04/05, 16:51 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 16:54 - Neo: She wants you to pat her back it's itchy
2018/04/05, 16:54 - Neo: And you didn't attend to her itch
2018/04/05, 16:54 - Neo: So she did it on her oen
2018/04/05, 16:54 - Neo: Own
2018/04/05, 16:54 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 16:55 - Jhyan: It's a behavioural trait in dogs
2018/04/05, 16:55 - Neo: My dog and Justin's old dog did that
2018/04/05, 16:55 - Jhyan: The betas would do this in front of the alphas to expose their jugular vein
2018/04/05, 16:56 - Jhyan: To show that they know who's in charge
2018/04/05, 16:56 - Neo: Lmao Savannah believes you're in charge?
2018/04/05, 16:56 - Jhyan: The owner
2018/04/05, 16:57 - Neo: What
2018/04/05, 16:57 - Neo: Y/N
2018/04/05, 16:57 - Jhyan: Y
2018/04/05, 16:57 - Neo: Ok lol
2018/04/05, 16:57 - Neo: She doesn't exactly listen to you
2018/04/05, 16:58 - Jhyan: That's not how it works
2018/04/05, 16:58 - Neo: Ok den
2018/04/05, 16:58 - Neo: I think her back is itchy
2018/04/05, 16:59 - Jhyan: Would the alpha instruct the betas to do things
2018/04/05, 17:00 - Neo: But commands and communication are the base of forming a collective society
2018/04/05, 17:00 - Jhyan: That's why dogs don't have advanced societies
2018/04/05, 17:00 - Jhyan: Or wolves
2018/04/05, 17:01 - Neo: But if a dog wanted to play with another dog and the one didn't want to play what would happen
2018/04/05, 17:01 - Neo: Maybe a little fight
2018/04/05, 17:01 - Neo: To say "No"
2018/04/05, 17:01 - Neo: That counts as a command, no?
2018/04/05, 17:02 - Jhyan: Ok but the fact that I can pick her up and move her at what she would think is warp speed is evident enough
2018/04/05, 17:02 - Jhyan: And also because I behave like I own her
2018/04/05, 17:03 - Neo: Evident to?
2018/04/05, 17:03 - Jhyan: That I'm the one in charge
2018/04/05, 17:03 - Jhyan: Or one of the ones in charge in this case
2018/04/05, 17:03 - Neo: It could be that you're way bigger than her
2018/04/05, 17:03 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/05, 17:04 - Jhyan: There are a lot of factors
2018/04/05, 17:04 - Neo: What does that have to do with scratching dogs back lol
2018/04/05, 17:04 - Jhyan: It has to do with your questions
2018/04/05, 17:04 - Jhyan: *question
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Neo: Yeah I just realised
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Jhyan: And the fact that it's not that her back is itchy
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Neo: I believe your dogs back is itchy
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Neo: Lol
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/05, 17:05 - Jhyan: But I have access to more resources so my predictions are more accurate
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Neo: Ask someone if they think its your dog is itchy or if its her submitting to you
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Neo: Y
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Jhyan: Because it's something that isn't obvious
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Jhyan: All that would tell me is that it looks like her back is itchy
2018/04/05, 17:06 - Jhyan: But in actual fact it's not
2018/04/05, 17:07 - Neo: Why would you not petting her back correlate with submitting to you
2018/04/05, 17:08 - Jhyan: I'm too lazy to have this argument
2018/04/05, 17:08 - Neo: They don't correlate
2018/04/05, 17:08 - Neo: They don't connect it doesn't make sense
2018/04/05, 17:09 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 17:09 - Jhyan: Her back is NOT itchy
2018/04/05, 17:10 - Jhyan: That is a Jack Russell's playful nature combined with the fact that they lie on their backs like that
2018/04/05, 17:10 - Neo: All dogs raised the right way would have a playful nature
2018/04/05, 17:10 - Jhyan: Jesus
2018/04/05, 17:11 - Jhyan: Jack Russells have more of that in their GENETICS
2018/04/05, 17:11 - Jhyan: 🅱ℹg 🅱🅾ℹ
2018/04/05, 17:11 - Neo: Yeah that's true
2018/04/05, 17:11 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/05, 17:13 - Neo: If you scratched your dog's back it would groaned or kicked its leg repeatedly
2018/04/05, 17:45 - Jhyan: It doesn't
2018/04/05, 17:45 - Neo: If you did
2018/04/05, 17:45 - Neo: Past tense
2018/04/05, 17:45 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 17:46 - Jhyan: That's not the cause
2018/04/05, 17:47 - Neo: How do you knaow
2018/04/05, 17:47 - Neo: Diwvx
2018/04/05, 17:48 - Neo: Haha
2018/04/05, 17:48 - Neo: That was me spamming the keyboard out of frustration
2018/04/05, 20:17 - Neo: We can do something next week maybe late in the evening because there's something I need from Tamara
2018/04/05, 20:18 - Jhyan: When

2018/04/05, 20:19 - Jhyan: I don't understand
2018/04/05, 20:22 - Jhyan: 🅱🅾ℹ
2018/04/05, 20:26 - Neo: Next week I can sleep over after Tamara gives back a necklace
2018/04/05, 20:26 - Jhyan: Wtf
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Jhyan: Why couldn't you before
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Jhyan: And no I can't
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Jhyan: That was when I was going to do the thing
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Neo: What
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Jhyan: But explain what you're talking about
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Jhyan: It's very confusing
2018/04/05, 20:27 - Neo: Same

2018/04/05, 20:28 - Jhyan: C'mon
2018/04/05, 20:28 - Jhyan: So Tamara has your necklace
2018/04/05, 20:28 - Jhyan: But the necklace is cursed and if anyone has it except you, you don't be able to sleep over at anyone's house?
2018/04/05, 20:29 - Jhyan: And late evening?
2018/04/05, 20:29 - Jhyan: And next weekend was booked but suddenly it's not?
2018/04/05, 20:29 - Neo: I'm confused

2018/04/05, 20:37 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 20:37 - Neo: That's my what the basis is

2018/04/05, 20:52 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/05, 20:52 - Jhyan: And then
2018/04/05, 20:52 - Neo: ?
2018/04/05, 20:53 - Jhyan: Why do you have to do that first
2018/04/05, 20:53 - Neo: That's the reason  I wouldve had to come later i  the evening
2018/04/05, 20:53 - Jhyan: And why was that weekend booked before but now isn't?
2018/04/05, 20:53 - Neo: No the wedding is this week
2018/04/05, 20:54 - Jhyan: Jesus the Holy 🅱🅾ℹ
2018/04/05, 20:54 - Jhyan: I'm talking about the next one
2018/04/05, 20:54 - Jhyan: As we HAVE BEEN talking about
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Neo: You know what
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Neo: We can do this next month
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Jhyan: Idc
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Jhyan: Just tell me what happened
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Neo: :(
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Neo: When?
2018/04/05, 20:55 - Jhyan: Please
2018/04/05, 20:56 - Jhyan: What will happen*
2018/04/05, 20:56 - Jhyan: Does this necklace make you immortal?
2018/04/05, 20:56 - Jhyan: Because it seems like just a necklace
2018/04/05, 20:56 - Jhyan: So why would you get it first
2018/04/05, 20:56 - Neo: Ye
2018/04/05, 20:57 - Neo: So that I could've seen you
2018/04/05, 20:57 - Jhyan: And take so long as to waste hours on getting a necklace
2018/04/05, 20:57 - Jhyan: That makes no sense
2018/04/05, 20:57 - Jhyan: How about sleep over Saturday then when you leave on Sunday you meet up with Tam and get the necklace, then go home?
2018/04/05, 20:58 - Jhyan: That is more logical
2018/04/05, 20:59 - Jhyan: Dude
2018/04/05, 20:59 - Jhyan: It's so easy
2018/04/05, 20:59 - Jhyan: Unless you're not just getting the necklace
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Neo: Nah its okay we can do this next month lol
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Jhyan: NO
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Jhyan: I don't care about they
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Jhyan: *that
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Jhyan: I just want to understand this
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Neo: Yes
2018/04/05, 21:00 - Jhyan: That's not why I'm so insistent
2018/04/05, 21:01 - Jhyan: It's because I'm angry that you keep not telling me
2018/04/05, 21:01 - Jhyan: And it makes no sense
2018/04/05, 21:01 - Neo: Idk explained
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Neo: I explained
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Jhyan: Why do you take so long to get a fucking necklace
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Jhyan: And why do it first
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Neo: I would get the necklace and visit
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Jhyan: And not afterwards
2018/04/05, 21:02 - Jhyan: Or first but don't take long
2018/04/05, 21:03 - Neo: Okay
2018/04/05, 21:03 - Jhyan: O FUCKING K????
2018/04/05, 21:03 - Jhyan: Why are you doing this
2018/04/05, 21:03 - Jhyan: Just tell me the reason
2018/04/05, 21:03 - Neo: For
2018/04/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: This
2018/04/05, 21:04 - Neo: Yeah sure I'll go back in time and tell you I'd get the necklace after I visit you
2018/04/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: And it doesn't take 6 hours to visit
2018/04/05, 21:04 - Jhyan: Assuming you go at 9
2018/04/05, 21:05 - Jhyan: Which is modest, given your "late evening" prediction
2018/04/05, 21:05 - Neo: Late is three
2018/04/05, 21:05 - Neo: Lol
2018/04/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: You see
2018/04/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: You would take even longer
2018/04/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: For it to be late evening
2018/04/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: So let's add 3 hours...
2018/04/05, 21:06 - Jhyan: That gives us a whopping, ginormous 12 HOURS TO DRINK A CUP OF TEA
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Jhyan: Wait
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Jhyan: My maths is wrong
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Jhyan: 9 hours
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Jhyan: 🤨
2018/04/05, 21:07 - Jhyan: Fuck
2018/04/05, 21:09 - Neo: Yes
2018/04/05, 21:09 - Jhyan: 9 hours
2018/04/05, 21:09 - Jhyan: To drink tea and ask how they are
2018/04/05, 21:10 - Jhyan: And catch up on what happened last weekend
2018/04/05, 21:10 - Jhyan: How the hell
2018/04/05, 21:13 - Neo: Relax
2018/04/05, 21:13 - Neo: Why are you so aggressive about iy
2018/04/05, 21:14 - Jhyan: Because
2018/04/05, 21:14 - Neo: I've never seen you so persistent about something like this
2018/04/11, 14:26 - Neo: That's still quite a bit
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Jhyan: Sorry my backup deleted messages for like 24 hours before
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Jhyan: What's still quite a bit
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Jhyan: I got a new phone
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Jhyan: J5 Pro
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Neo: Gross
2018/04/11, 14:27 - Jhyan: It came with my sister's S8
2018/04/11, 14:28 - Jhyan: For free
2018/04/11, 14:28 - Jhyan: And my S5 was falling apart at the seams
2018/04/11, 14:28 - Neo: Oh well
2018/04/11, 14:28 - Neo: Something's better than nothing
2018/04/11, 14:29 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 14:36 - Neo: What's the video quality and camera quality
2018/04/11, 14:36 - Neo: Man idk you have a PS4 and a PC you have everything you want
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Jhyan: Wdym
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Jhyan: 13MP
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Jhyan: Idk video quality
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Jhyan: And I'm too lazy
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Neo: No as video output
2018/04/11, 14:37 - Neo: You can check on Youtube
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Neo: Have they installed Fibre at on your road yet
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Jhyan: 1920X1080
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Jhyan: My mom is gonna get it at the end of the year possibly
2018/04/11, 14:38 - Jhyan: Or like next month
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Jhyan: It depends
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Jhyan: Answer this
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Neo: I don't understand why you want the latest phone so bad when you've been getting what you wanted
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Jhyan: I don't
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Jhyan: I just don't want a laggy piece of crap that takes 43 seconds to open WhatsApp
2018/04/11, 14:39 - Neo: Last I was time I was there you were complaining about the phone your sister has
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Jhyan: And has a burnt out screen
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Jhyan: Yes because it's not fair that she got that for free
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Neo: Wait so didn't put up the poles at your house
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Jhyan: They did but it's not connected
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Jhyan: And I don't have everything I want
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Neo: Or no one knocked on your gate asking about installation fees
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/11, 14:40 - Jhyan: Long ago
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Jhyan: Before they put it in
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Neo: You have about 15 ps4 games and a great computer and your sister doesn't get much
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Neo: I presume
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Jhyan: And besides you can just find the best deal online
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Jhyan: No I don't have 15
2018/04/11, 14:41 - Jhyan: I have very slow internet
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Jhyan: I don't have an HTC Vive
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Jhyan: And you aren't looking at the facts
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Jhyan: My sister has a 30 000 horse
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Neo: Oh
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Jhyan: And she gets expensive money used on her horseriding lessons
2018/04/11, 14:42 - Jhyan: And etc
2018/04/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: And she is one of those idiotic people that buy branded clothes and shoes because they're popular and for no other reason
2018/04/11, 14:43 - Neo: How many games do you have
2018/04/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: So that's a huge expense
2018/04/11, 14:43 - Neo: Digital and discs
2018/04/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: Like 8 or 9
2018/04/11, 14:44 - Jhyan: 3 discs
2018/04/11, 14:44 - Neo: List them
2018/04/11, 14:45 - Neo: Besides you have more PC games
2018/04/11, 14:45 - Jhyan: Infamous: Second Son
Destiny
Fallout 4
Evolve
Need For Speed: Rivals
No Man's Sky
2018/04/11, 14:45 - Jhyan: I didn't buy all of those
2018/04/11, 14:45 - Jhyan: So those don't count
2018/04/11, 14:45 - Jhyan: And a LOT of them were bought with my own money
2018/04/11, 14:46 - Neo: My point being you have so much but still don't appreciate it
2018/04/11, 14:46 - Jhyan: I appreciate it
2018/04/11, 14:46 - Jhyan: I didn't get my computer instantly either
2018/04/11, 14:47 - Jhyan: I had to give up things like presents and snacks for 3 years
2018/04/11, 14:47 - Jhyan: And I payed for it with most of my money that I still had left
2018/04/11, 14:47 - Jhyan: Contributed to*
2018/04/11, 14:47 - Neo: If you appreciated it you'd talk about how much you have and not what you'd want
2018/04/11, 14:48 - Neo: Why are you playing victim
2018/04/11, 14:48 - Jhyan: Just because I want more doesn't ever mean I funny appreciate what I have
2018/04/11, 14:48 - Jhyan: Because you're acting as if I got all this stuff for free without any sacrifice
2018/04/11, 14:49 - Jhyan: If I was the richest man on Earth, that doesn't stop me from wanting immortality
2018/04/11, 14:49 - Neo: No that's not what I'm implying, you just need to appreciate what you have
2018/04/11, 14:49 - Jhyan: *funny was supposed to be don't
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Jhyan: I do though
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Neo: Sure
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Neo: Can you connect a PS4 controller to you PC
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Neo: Don't you prefer the controller
2018/04/11, 14:50 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 14:51 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 14:51 - Jhyan: Only for certain games
2018/04/11, 14:51 - Jhyan: Like INSIDE or Stick Fight: The Game
2018/04/11, 14:51 - Neo: Let's just exclude FPS games because saying using a controller for those is a lie
2018/04/11, 14:51 - Jhyan: Or Styx
2018/04/11, 14:52 - Jhyan: I don't use controllers for FPS games
2018/04/11, 14:52 - Neo: Is better*
2018/04/11, 14:52 - Jhyan: You are rarted
2018/04/11, 14:52 - Neo: Ye ik I'm just saying Mouse and Keyboard is better for fps
2018/04/11, 14:52 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/11, 14:54 - Neo: But controllers are so straightforward
2018/04/11, 14:54 - Jhyan: Yeah but they're inaccurate
2018/04/11, 14:54 - Jhyan: And limited
2018/04/11, 14:54 - Neo: Limited?
2018/04/11, 14:54 - Jhyan: How many buttons does a keyboard have
2018/04/11, 14:55 - Jhyan: And a gaming mouse
2018/04/11, 14:55 - Jhyan: But they give you a better sense of control for some games
2018/04/11, 14:55 - Neo: I mean it's not like you'd need 100 buttons to play a game
2018/04/11, 14:55 - Jhyan: And those games are usually match a controller's simplicity
2018/04/11, 14:56 - Jhyan: Ⓜ8⃣ look at Oxygen Not Included
2018/04/11, 14:56 - Jhyan: And plus, I can open the Alchemy tab instantly in The Witcher
2018/04/11, 14:57 - Jhyan: And I can actually use the internet without slowly dying inside
2018/04/11, 14:57 - Neo: What games would need more than 15 buttons
2018/04/11, 14:57 - Jhyan: ^^^^^^^^^^
2018/04/11, 14:58 - Jhyan: And anyway that's not the only reason
2018/04/11, 14:58 - Jhyan: Like point and click games
2018/04/11, 14:58 - Jhyan: You don't want to wait for a controller your cursor to inch across the screen
2018/04/11, 14:58 - Neo: *need*
2018/04/11, 14:59 - Jhyan: You want to move the mouse quickly
2018/04/11, 14:59 - Neo: Sensitivity is a thing
2018/04/11, 14:59 - Neo: Sensitivity increase*
2018/04/11, 14:59 - Jhyan: Item>pickup>interact
2018/04/11, 15:00 - Jhyan: Not item>wait>pickup>press wrong thing>back>wait>interact
2018/04/11, 15:01 - Neo: What
2018/04/11, 15:01 - Neo: I don't understand that
2018/04/11, 15:01 - Jhyan: If you don't understand why this doesn't solve the problem you shouldn't be having this argument
2018/04/11, 15:01 - Neo: Or its just never happened to me
2018/04/11, 15:02 - Neo: Woah do you have Oxygen Not Included
2018/04/11, 15:02 - Neo: Besides I'm pretty sure that game is going to come to console
2018/04/11, 15:02 - Jhyan: A controller uses direction like a guy telling someone where to go
2018/04/11, 15:03 - Neo: What
2018/04/11, 15:03 - Jhyan: A mouse is like using telekinesis to move an object at the same speed as your hand
2018/04/11, 15:03 - Jhyan: Mice have pinpoints on the screen
2018/04/11, 15:03 - Jhyan: Controllers just gave a direction
2018/04/11, 15:03 - Neo: No but most games have short cuts to do stuff that would usually take long
2018/04/11, 15:04 - Jhyan: Context
2018/04/11, 15:04 - Neo: Like the witcher you could actually open one of the tabs with a key
2018/04/11, 15:04 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 15:05 - Jhyan: They will simplify the controls GREATLY
2018/04/11, 15:05 - Jhyan: And you won't be able to do things fast
2018/04/11, 15:05 - Jhyan: You might press a button to let you select an action, and you cycle through to disinfect
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Jhyan: But on PC you just press F8 or whatever it is and BAM
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Neo: And in Let It Die you can actually throw away items with the X button and arrow keys in stead of going to the Death Bag and throwing it away
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Jhyan: Plus you still have to move to the block you want to disinfect
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Jhyan: While we can just skip over all the blocks and go directly to it
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Jhyan: You have to pass through every block
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Neo: Does seem convenient
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Neo: And it actually is
2018/04/11, 15:06 - Jhyan: Yeah but you can just press G or something
2018/04/11, 15:07 - Neo: The game's not on PC
2018/04/11, 15:07 - Jhyan: Not the point
2018/04/11, 15:07 - Neo: Ye
2018/04/11, 15:07 - Jhyan: It's a game mechanic common for many, many games
2018/04/11, 15:08 - Jhyan: It doesn't have to be talking about LET IT DIE
2018/04/11, 15:08 - Neo: But if Klei was smart they'd use a combination of buttons to do that kind of stuff
2018/04/11, 15:08 - Jhyan: Why
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Neo: Because it's a shortcut
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Jhyan: It makes more complications
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Jhyan: Extra buttons
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Jhyan: No it's not
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Jhyan: Just 1 button for each thing works
2018/04/11, 15:09 - Jhyan: Very efficiently
2018/04/11, 15:10 - Neo: So you think it's easier to  "cycle through options" than press x and the left arrow key for exanple
2018/04/11, 15:10 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 15:10 - Jhyan: That's a combination of buttons
2018/04/11, 15:10 - Jhyan: Which I disagreed with
2018/04/11, 15:10 - Neo: Then why disagree with me
2018/04/11, 15:11 - Jhyan: Because you said if they were smart they would use a combination of buttons
2018/04/11, 15:11 - Neo: You disagree with pressing two buttons at the same timw
2018/04/11, 15:11 - Jhyan: And it was replying to what I said about how the PC controls work
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Jhyan: I thought you meant they should change how the PC controls work
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Jhyan: Because that's the message you responded to
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Neo: No lol
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Jhyan: I understand now
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Neo: If they were to release it on console
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Jhyan: But then it's way less user friendly
2018/04/11, 15:12 - Jhyan: A lot of people would be like no I'm not doing that
2018/04/11, 15:13 - Jhyan: It's why I hate fighting games
2018/04/11, 15:13 - Jhyan: I only stick to 3 or 4 combos
2018/04/11, 15:13 - Neo: A lot of people would cycle through options than press two buttons?
2018/04/11, 15:13 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 15:13 - Jhyan: You press a button to let you cycle
2018/04/11, 15:14 - Jhyan: Then you select
2018/04/11, 15:14 - Neo: Mortal Kombat is not a bad game
2018/04/11, 15:14 - Neo: You'd rather do that then press two buttons????
2018/04/11, 15:14 - Jhyan: Correct, but it's not very user friendly
2018/04/11, 15:15 - Jhyan: There are up to 55 different things that you will have to remember the button combinations to
2018/04/11, 15:15 - Jhyan: A different combination for each
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Neo: Yeah you'd get used to it, no?
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Jhyan: Only select people
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Jhyan: And just because you can do it doesn't mean it's a good system
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/11, 15:16 - Jhyan: It's difficult
2018/04/11, 15:17 - Jhyan: I'm gonna go eat some ribs
2018/04/11, 15:17 - Jhyan: Brb
2018/04/11, 15:17 - Neo: Ok bye
2018/04/11, 15:17 - Neo: If you can't remember stuff like that why even play a 50 gig game
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Jhyan: What
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Jhyan: It's not 50 gigs
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Neo: Idk most games are
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Neo: I just assumed
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Jhyan: Dude it's 2D
2018/04/11, 15:18 - Jhyan: Fully
2018/04/11, 15:19 - Jhyan: With no advanced graphics
2018/04/11, 15:19 - Neo: Ik
2018/04/11, 15:19 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/11, 15:20 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/04/11, 15:20 - Neo: But it's not difficult to remember
2018/04/11, 15:20 - Neo: Without tutorials
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Jhyan: Yes it is
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Jhyan: Distinct is RB + X
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Neo: RB?
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Jhyan: Wait shit I pressed o
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Neo: Distinct?
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Neo: What
2018/04/11, 15:21 - Jhyan: L1
2018/04/11, 15:22 - Jhyan: Disinfect
2018/04/11, 15:22 - Neo: How long have you had a PS4 for that you press O over x
2018/04/11, 15:23 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/04/11, 15:23 - Jhyan: Maybe that was a stupid example
2018/04/11, 15:24 - Jhyan: But there's no way you're going to remember what the button for sweep is out of 55± combinations
2018/04/11, 15:24 - Neo: Even if you change console that shouldn't be possible
2018/04/11, 15:24 - Jhyan: I realize why I said it now
2018/04/11, 15:24 - Jhyan: I often press the wrong button when I'm doing combinations due to the strange position
2018/04/11, 15:24 - Jhyan: And tension
2018/04/11, 15:25 - Jhyan: Of your fingers
2018/04/11, 15:25 - Neo: What
2018/04/11, 15:25 - Neo: Now you're just making stuff up
2018/04/11, 15:25 - Jhyan: The combination I said isn't that complex
2018/04/11, 15:25 - Jhyan: I'm not making stuff up
2018/04/11, 15:26 - Jhyan: I'm a fucking INTJ I don't mess with knowledge like that
2018/04/11, 15:26 - Jhyan: And it's stupid
2018/04/11, 15:27 - Jhyan: Because if I made stuff up I wouldn't be able to explain it
2018/04/11, 15:27 - Jhyan: So you would disregard my entire argument because of a thing that someone like Massimo would do
2018/04/11, 15:28 - Neo: It's not that difficult to press *two buttons* at a time
2018/04/11, 15:28 - Neo: Look gtg
2018/04/11, 15:28 - Jhyan: Ok what if you have to press X and ∆
2018/04/11, 15:28 - Neo: That's not to difficult
2018/04/11, 15:29 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 15:29 - Jhyan: It's not intuitive
2018/04/11, 15:30 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/11, 15:31 - Jhyan: And then you need to press R1
2018/04/11, 15:31 - Neo: You let go of the buttons and press it
2018/04/11, 15:32 - Jhyan: Idc
2018/04/11, 15:32 - Neo: Or use your middle finger
2018/04/11, 15:32 - Jhyan: They can do it on console, it's still worse than on PC
2018/04/11, 15:32 - Neo: Gtg
2018/04/11, 15:32 - Jhyan: K
2018/04/11, 17:01 - Neo: Yaayyy Morty Yaay
2018/04/11, 17:01 - Jhyan: What
2018/04/11, 17:01 - Neo: Did you not see it
2018/04/11, 17:01 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/04/11, 17:03 - Neo: https://youtu.be/v6yg4ImnYwA
2018/04/11, 17:04 - Neo: It's 11 minutes
2018/04/11, 17:04 - Jhyan: Yeah I saw it a few days ago
2018/04/11, 17:05 - Neo: Yaayyy morty yayy
2018/04/11, 17:05 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/11, 17:14 - Neo: :(
2018/04/11, 17:14 - Jhyan: Just wait I'm configuring settings
2018/04/11, 17:16 - Neo: JuSt WaIt I'M CoNfIgUrInG sEtTiNgs
2018/04/11, 17:30 - Neo: How cool would it be to be a skeleton
2018/04/11, 17:30 - Jhyan: Ikr
2018/04/11, 17:32 - Neo: But then you'd have to die
2018/04/11, 17:32 - Neo: Or if you could move like a person you'd be blind
2018/04/11, 17:32 - Jhyan: Ok say you had the power of invisibility
2018/04/11, 17:32 - Jhyan: But only for your flesh
2018/04/11, 17:32 - Neo: But if you took out all the drawbacks it'd be too cool
2018/04/11, 17:33 - Neo: Or everything but your skeleton and everything would work how it worked if it wasn't invisible
2018/04/11, 17:33 - Jhyan: But your pupils are visible then
2018/04/11, 17:33 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 17:33 - Jhyan: This is Skulduggery Pleasant
2018/04/11, 17:33 - Neo: Wait if you were invisible wouldn't you get scurvy or an illness related to the lack of vitamin D
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: Ok wait
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Neo: Why
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: Invisible but not so that light passes through you
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Neo: Sunlight = vitamin d
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Neo: But that's what invisibility is
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: You just convert all light into radio frequency lightwaves
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: And other people can't see that
2018/04/11, 17:34 - Jhyan: So you still get hit by the light
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: And you have a shadow
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Neo: Woah
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: Wait
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: It doesn't work
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: You'd just be 100% black
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: vantablack
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Neo: Being a skeleton with normal human functions > invisibility with normal human functions
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Neo: Oof
2018/04/11, 17:35 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/11, 17:50 - Jhyan: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pet.ugandanknucklespet
2018/04/11, 18:19 - Neo: "12+"
2018/04/11, 22:42 - Jhyan: Dude
2018/04/11, 22:42 - Jhyan: I fucking got it working
2018/04/11, 22:42 - Jhyan: The AI
2018/04/11, 22:43 - Jhyan: I need to train it though
2018/04/11, 22:43 - Neo: Nice
2018/04/11, 22:44 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/11, 22:44 - Jhyan: I got it to walk right in INSIDE
2018/04/11, 22:45 - Jhyan: I should probably get a simpler game to use it with
2018/04/11, 22:46 - Neo: Like?
2018/04/11, 22:46 - Jhyan: Dude I feel like I just beat Dark Souls
2018/04/11, 22:46 - Jhyan: That's how hard it was to make this work
2018/04/11, 22:46 - Neo: Well done
2018/04/11, 22:47 - Jhyan: Like maybe Isaac
2018/04/11, 22:47 - Jhyan: Or something
2018/04/11, 22:47 - Neo: Huh
2018/04/11, 22:48 - Neo: Try get a demo
2018/04/11, 22:48 - Neo: Or use game that doesn't master
2018/04/11, 22:48 - Neo: Matter
2018/04/11, 22:48 - Jhyan: Why not
2018/04/11, 22:48 - Jhyan: Just search Isaac game
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Jhyan: Isaac: Rebirth
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Neo: Use the AI on game's that don't matter
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Jhyan: Why
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Neo: Ik the game
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Jhyan: It doesn't break the game
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Neo: Doesn't *
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Neo: What if it corrupts data
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/11, 22:49 - Neo: Man I have to sleep
2018/04/11, 22:50 - Jhyan: You have no comprehension
2018/04/11, 22:50 - Jhyan: Ok sleep
2018/04/11, 22:50 - Jhyan: It's basically like a network that can press keyboard buttons and understand what it's doing
2018/04/12, 18:41 - Jhyan: Tell your parents to check theirs WhatsApp
2018/04/12, 18:41 - Jhyan: My mom invited you
2018/04/12, 18:42 - Neo: Ik
2018/04/12, 18:42 - Neo: I said I couldn't come
2018/04/12, 18:42 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/12, 18:42 - Neo: Actually I said we should this next month
2018/04/12, 18:42 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/12, 18:43 - Neo: ;(
2018/04/12, 18:43 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/12, 18:44 - Jhyan: I didn't care about that in that instance because I was trying to find out something else
2018/04/12, 18:44 - Neo: Do u like Tamara
2018/04/12, 18:44 - Jhyan: Why
2018/04/12, 18:46 - Neo: Why are you so obsessed with her
2018/04/12, 18:46 - Jhyan: I'm not obsessed with her
2018/04/12, 18:46 - Jhyan: It just didn't make sense
2018/04/12, 18:46 - Jhyan: And that is disturbing
2018/04/12, 18:47 - Jhyan: When things don't work efficiently
2018/04/12, 18:47 - Neo: Yeah but usually you're not like that
2018/04/12, 18:47 - Jhyan: I am
2018/04/12, 18:48 - Neo: No lol
2018/04/12, 18:48 - Jhyan: Hmm
2018/04/12, 18:48 - Jhyan: It affected me
2018/04/12, 18:48 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Jhyan: Coz it caused you to have to come later
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Neo: No lol
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Jhyan: What other evidence do you have
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Neo: I think it has something to do with that thing Tamara said
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Neo: She said she couldn't tell me why
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Neo: But she was meeting with you
2018/04/12, 18:49 - Jhyan: ?
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Jhyan: Didn't happen
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Jhyan: That was the thing I was ominous about
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Jhyan: But either way, whatever you think, it's wrong
2018/04/12, 18:50 - Neo: I'm a mystery solver
2018/04/12, 18:51 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/12, 18:51 - Jhyan: No you're a person who was told the answer
2018/04/12, 18:51 - Neo: Detective Neo
2018/04/12, 18:51 - Jhyan: I don't understand why she would even mention it though
2018/04/12, 18:51 - Neo: Because I'm her best friend
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Don't ask her that though
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: No you're not
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Or do
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Ask her
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: I know who her best friend is
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Actually
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Yeah me
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Bith
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: If I told you it would blow your mind
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Neo: Yeah lol its some girl called Ari
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: And get you demoted from detective
2018/04/12, 18:52 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/12, 18:53 - Jhyan: Shit
2018/04/12, 18:53 - Neo: She told me that last year
2018/04/12, 18:53 - Jhyan: That means you don't know
2018/04/12, 18:54 - Jhyan: Good, good
2018/04/12, 18:54 - Jhyan: Haha I'm just messing with you
2018/04/12, 18:54 - Neo: >:(
2018/04/12, 18:54 - Jhyan: Or am I?!;???????!!???
2018/04/12, 18:54 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/04/12, 18:55 - Jhyan: So why can't you come over
2018/04/12, 18:55 - Neo: I already planned the weekend with Alex
2018/04/12, 18:55 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/12, 18:56 - Jhyan: Wait
2018/04/12, 18:56 - Jhyan: Wouldn't you automatically assume that I like Tam
2018/04/12, 18:56 - Jhyan: If you knew I was meeting her
2018/04/12, 18:56 - Jhyan: But no details
2018/04/12, 18:56 - Neo: Because two weeks ago he was in Germany and we said we'd see each other on the second week he gets back
2018/04/12, 18:57 - Neo: What
2018/04/12, 18:57 - Neo: Jhyan
2018/04/12, 18:57 - Neo: Jhyan
2018/04/12, 18:57 - Neo: You spam my phone because I said something about Tamara
2018/04/12, 18:57 - Neo: Then you meet with her
2018/04/12, 18:58 - Jhyan: And so you would assume I like her right?
2018/04/12, 18:58 - Jhyan: But you didn't
2018/04/12, 18:58 - Neo: What
2018/04/12, 18:58 - Jhyan: That's what perplexes me
2018/04/12, 18:58 - Neo: Huh
2018/04/12, 18:59 - Jhyan: Because you asked me if I did, instead of said I did
2018/04/12, 18:59 - Neo: How does reddit work
2018/04/12, 18:59 - Jhyan: Ay
2018/04/12, 18:59 - Jhyan: First answer
2018/04/12, 19:00 - Neo: Look i have no idea what you're saying lol
2018/04/12, 19:00 - Jhyan: You asked me if I like Tamara right?
2018/04/12, 19:00 - Neo: Ye
2018/04/12, 19:00 - Jhyan: And you didn't go straight to claiming that I like her right?
2018/04/12, 19:01 - Neo: Sure
2018/04/12, 19:01 - Neo: That's normal
2018/04/12, 19:01 - Neo: Lol
2018/04/12, 19:01 - Jhyan: I'm asking why you didn't, because it would make more sense to claim rather than ask, provided the information you had
2018/04/12, 19:02 - Jhyan: What about it
2018/04/12, 19:03 - Neo: Because only a reckless detective would do that
2018/04/12, 19:03 - Jhyan: I'm assuming it's because sometimes people don't follow pure logic exactly and rather use something like a learned phrase
2018/04/12, 19:03 - Jhyan: Fair point
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Neo: Hehe
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Neo: Anyways
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Jhyan: But that means you still think there's more to the case
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Neo: I think i have an account
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Jhyan: Anyway**
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Jhyan: There's no such word as anyways
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Jhyan: Yeah and...
2018/04/12, 19:04 - Neo: I want to know how to use it
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Neo: My friend said reddit is for normies
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Jhyan: You go to a subreddit you like
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Jhyan: Like r/dankmemes
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Neo: Subreddit is a category
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Jhyan: And you browse it
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Neo: What
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Neo: Oh simple
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Jhyan: And you can subscribe to get posts from that category in your home page
2018/04/12, 19:05 - Neo: So there's no aspect to following someone
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Neo: Oh you follow categories not people
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Jhyan: And if you want, you can unsubscribe from r/music or something
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Jhyan: You can find accounts of people with their username
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Neo: Oh
2018/04/12, 19:06 - Jhyan: Correct
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Neo: So it's similar to 9gag
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Jhyan: Kinda
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Jhyan: With the accounts
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Jhyan: But it's much more versatile
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Neo: Okay
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Jhyan: You can use it to ask about bugs on a game or something
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Neo: So how would I find your account
2018/04/12, 19:07 - Neo: For example
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Jhyan: It's called Jhyanisawesome
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Jhyan: You can search it in Reddit
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Neo: Oh wait can you directly message someone
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Jhyan: I'm not sure about this
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Neo: Like if John had it
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/12, 19:08 - Jhyan: Or you can go to reddit.com/u/Jhyanisawesome
2018/04/12, 19:09 - Neo: What's happened to John
2018/04/12, 19:09 - Jhyan: In the Caribbean
2018/04/12, 19:10 - Neo: Why
2018/04/12, 19:10 - Neo: When was the last time you talked to someone
2018/04/12, 19:10 - Jhyan: Cod
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Jhyan: ?
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Neo: I meant to say John
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Neo: It's pretty good lol
2018/04/12, 19:11 - Jhyan: That is my post
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Jhyan: Look at my memes
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Jhyan: Or just through my whole account
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Neo: Ok
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Neo: Whats karma
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Jhyan: It's like good use points
2018/04/12, 19:12 - Jhyan: *user
2018/04/12, 19:13 - Jhyan: Like it shows how much you contribute and how good you are as a poster
2018/04/12, 19:13 - Jhyan: So if you get lots of upvotes, you get more karma
2018/04/12, 19:14 - Jhyan: And you need it to post in some subreddits
2018/04/12, 19:14 - Jhyan: Like r/memes requires some karma that is specific to the subreddit
2018/04/12, 19:14 - Jhyan: But you can't see how much you have for each
2018/04/12, 19:14 - Jhyan: It just shows a total
2018/04/12, 19:15 - Neo: Ye
2018/04/12, 19:15 - Neo: Okay
2018/04/12, 19:15 - Neo: This is normie

2018/04/12, 19:15 - Jhyan: And actually it is
2018/04/12, 19:15 - Jhyan: It's a thing normal people use
2018/04/12, 19:15 - Neo: "Literally anything else
2018/04/12, 19:16 - Neo: "
2018/04/12, 19:16 - Jhyan: But it's not 9gag level of normie for example
2018/04/12, 19:16 - Jhyan: Well he's an idiot
2018/04/12, 19:16 - Jhyan: I would only accept him saying that if he uses 4chan
2018/04/12, 19:16 - Neo: Lmao why you always say that
2018/04/12, 19:17 - Jhyan: When else

2018/04/12, 19:20 - Neo: On April 1st
2018/04/12, 19:20 - Neo: When André said Rick and Morty season 3 came out

2018/04/24, 17:09 - Jhyan: yes
2018/04/24, 17:09 - Jhyan: Obviously
2018/04/24, 17:10 - Neo: But a PC doesn't have a built in mic
2018/04/24, 17:10 - Neo: Lol
2018/04/24, 17:13 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/24, 17:13 - Neo: So it doesn't count

2018/04/25, 18:57 - Jhyan: It is actually illegal
2018/04/25, 18:58 - Jhyan: I do not have to accommodate when you are the one infringing
2018/04/25, 18:58 - Neo: Agh not a big deal
2018/04/25, 18:58 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/25, 18:58 - Neo: I'll change it
2018/04/25, 18:58 - Jhyan: Thanks
2018/04/25, 18:59 - Neo: Didn't know you were so babyish
2018/04/25, 20:15 - Jhyan: There are various people who could put two and two together
2018/04/25, 20:16 - Jhyan: Why are you personally attacking me for wanting to keep a very obviously bad representation of me off the internet
2018/04/25, 20:19 - Neo: Nah I could just say it was ripped
2018/04/25, 20:19 - Neo: How many people have seen your feet
2018/04/25, 20:19 - Jhyan: No
2018/04/25, 20:19 - Jhyan: My coffee table
2018/04/25, 20:20 - Neo: What's so distinctive about it
2018/04/25, 20:20 - Jhyan: The fact that you're my friend
2018/04/25, 20:20 - Jhyan: There may have been an object visible, I can't remember
2018/04/25, 20:20 - Jhyan: The fact that I'm white
2018/04/25, 20:21 - Jhyan: It's a low probability, but still plausible
2018/04/25, 20:22 - Neo: The white race is a majority in most of the countries that are still able to see it
2018/04/25, 20:22 - Jhyan: No, my foot is white lol
2018/04/25, 20:22 - Neo: Besides the people who follow me dont even know you
2018/04/25, 20:23 - Neo: And exaggerated
2018/04/25, 20:23 - Jhyan: Just
2018/04/25, 20:23 - Jhyan: It is a little bit extreme
2018/04/25, 20:24 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/25, 20:24 - Jhyan: But I think it's worth it
2018/04/25, 20:24 - Neo: Whut
2018/04/25, 20:24 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/04/25, 20:24 - Jhyan: I'm getting Star Citizen
2018/04/25, 20:25 - Neo: What's that
2018/04/25, 20:25 - Jhyan: It's a game
2018/04/25, 20:25 - Jhyan: Hi research
2018/04/25, 20:25 - Jhyan: *go
2018/04/25, 20:25 - Jhyan: Coz I'm lazy
2018/04/25, 20:27 - Neo: Ohhh
2018/04/25, 20:27 - Jhyan: What
2018/04/25, 20:27 - Neo: You mean No Man's Sky 2?
2018/04/25, 20:28 - Jhyan: Brb
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: Sorry
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: Kinda forgot about that
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: Yeah but it's not that
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: It's not infinite
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: So they have more to work with
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: It is multilayer
2018/04/25, 20:45 - Jhyan: *multiplayer
2018/04/25, 20:46 - Jhyan: With actual interactions
2018/04/25, 20:46 - Jhyan: There's an economy
2018/04/25, 20:46 - Jhyan: Like
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Jhyan: Don't think it's like No Man's Sky because it's gonna fall
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Jhyan: *fail
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Jhyan: People are already playing it
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Neo: I don't like those kinds of games
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Jhyan: Why
2018/04/25, 20:47 - Neo: You and I have very different tastes in games
2018/04/25, 20:48 - Jhyan: Why don't you like those games
2018/04/25, 20:48 - Neo: Idk
2018/04/25, 20:48 - Jhyan: It's more like a Venn diagram
2018/04/25, 20:48 - Neo: Venn diagram?
2018/04/25, 20:50 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/04/25, 20:50 - Jhyan: There
2018/04/25, 20:51 - Neo: Oh
2018/04/25, 20:51 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/04/25, 20:51 - Neo: Yeah I just Googled it lol
2018/04/25, 20:51 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/25, 20:52 - Jhyan: And the ones at the edges are different
2018/04/25, 20:52 - Jhyan: So you think we like very different games
2018/04/25, 20:52 - Jhyan: But it's like the diagram
2018/04/25, 20:59 - Jhyan: Oh the Galaxy is getting bigger
2018/04/25, 20:59 - Jhyan: And will be kinda infinite
2018/04/25, 20:59 - Jhyan: But still
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Jhyan: There's cities and stuff
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Neo: Seems
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Neo: Lame
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Jhyan: Wait gimme a game you like
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Jhyan: To prove we like different games
2018/04/25, 21:00 - Neo: A game we both like is the witcher 3
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: But besides that
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: One in the other area
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: Of the diagram
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Jhyan: Ok you can play it next time you come over and see
2018/04/25, 21:01 - Neo: Uhh
2018/04/25, 21:02 - Neo: Fortnite
2018/04/25, 21:02 - Neo: Pubg
2018/04/25, 21:02 - Neo: LID
2018/04/25, 21:02 - Jhyan: I don't like Fortnite for other reasons
2018/04/25, 21:02 - Jhyan: I like PUBG
2018/04/25, 21:03 - Neo: "I don't like Battle Royal games"
2018/04/25, 21:03 - Neo: I like cartoony games
2018/04/25, 21:03 - Jhyan: The game itself I like, but I hate the community, developers, basically how the game gets its money and exists
2018/04/25, 21:03 - Neo: Either cartoony or gritty and gorey
2018/04/25, 21:03 - Jhyan: Like?
2018/04/25, 21:04 - Neo: LBP
2018/04/25, 21:04 - Neo: Little Big Planet
2018/04/25, 21:04 - Jhyan: I loved that game
2018/04/25, 21:04 - Neo: Yeah honestly Fortnite skins (and CsGo and lots of other games) are a scam
2018/04/25, 21:05 - Jhyan: Let it Die was something I liked, but not as good as other games I had like Dark Souls imo, so wasn't worth playing
2018/04/25, 21:05 - Neo: Same
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Jhyan: Yeah but CSGO isn't really disgusting
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Jhyan: Like Fortnite
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Neo: Imo?
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Neo: I love LID
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Jhyan: In my opinion
2018/04/25, 21:06 - Neo: Yeah it is
2018/04/25, 21:07 - Neo: Skins are worth 1399
2018/04/25, 21:07 - Neo: And over
2018/04/25, 21:07 - Neo: Tf?
2018/04/25, 21:07 - Neo: You can get a whole another game
2018/04/25, 21:07 - Jhyan: Like it's still bad, but it isn't as prominent of a feature, the devs aren't just bad people, they get their money from purchasing the game
2018/04/25, 21:08 - Neo: Yeah I mean there is a PvE
2018/04/25, 21:08 - Jhyan: Also, they used and still use the fact that their game is free to one-up PUBG, which is better. If they were both free, PUBG would be in the lead.
2018/04/25, 21:10 - Jhyan: Wait hold on
2018/04/25, 21:10 - Jhyan: There must be SOMETHING you like that I don't
2018/04/25, 21:11 - Neo: God Of War
2018/04/25, 21:11 - Neo: The Division
2018/04/25, 21:11 - Jhyan: Nope
2018/04/25, 21:11 - Neo: I don't like it but at a point I did
2018/04/25, 21:11 - Jhyan: Neither of those
2018/04/25, 21:12 - Jhyan: I had God of War at one point, it was pretty fun
2018/04/25, 21:12 - Jhyan: You need better internet my dude
2018/04/25, 21:13 - Neo: Idk why it's acting up
2018/04/25, 21:13 - Jhyan: Lol
2018/04/25, 21:13 - Jhyan: What speed is it again
2018/04/25, 21:14 - Jhyan: Coz mine was slow compared to the average
2018/04/25, 21:14 - Jhyan: If you don't know, just search speed test and Google has a built in thing that lets you do it
2018/04/25, 21:16 - Neo: Yeah mines really bad because there's a lot of people home
2018/04/25, 21:16 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/25, 21:16 - Jhyan: Have you ever seen a deep fried meme
2018/04/25, 21:16 - Jhyan: But like a real one
2018/04/25, 21:18 - Jhyan: Ok bye I'm going to sleep
2018/04/25, 21:18 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2018/04/25, 21:22 - Neo: 700 kbps
2018/04/25, 21:22 - Jhyan: You

2018/04/25, 21:22 - Jhyan: But that's probs inaccurate coz of people using it
2018/04/25, 21:22 - Jhyan: K I'm out 🅱0⃣ℹ👌🏻😂👌🏻
2018/04/25, 21:23 - Neo: Bro that's an Instagram meme
2018/04/25, 21:23 - Neo: Besides DFMs are everywhere
2018/04/25, 21:24 - Jhyan: How did you come to this conclusion
2018/04/25, 21:24 - Jhyan: I want evidence that it was originally from Instagram or sthu
2018/04/25, 21:24 - Jhyan: Shut the heck up
2018/04/25, 21:25 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/25, 21:24 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/25, 21:24 - Neo: Oh no idk if its from instagram
2018/04/25, 21:25 - Neo: But the memes used are from instagram
2018/04/25, 21:29 - Jhyan: That bottom thing is a meme in itself
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: It may have come from Instagram, but that's like saying the prequel memes come from the Star Wars prequels
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Neo: The guy
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: It doesn't prove anything
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: Yes, that's a meme in itself
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: People put it on stuff to make a meme
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: Or combine it with other memes
2018/04/25, 21:30 - Jhyan: This is so sad meme
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Neo: Do you even know what the "we live in a society" thing is?
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Jhyan: I think that's the name
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Jhyan: I think so
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Neo: I knew that before you
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Neo: Ye?
2018/04/25, 21:31 - Jhyan: You don't know that
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Neo: Yeah I do
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Jhyan: Basically it came from one of those pictures that said we live in a society where blah blah blah stuff that isn't fair
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Jhyan: And then someone made a parody
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Jhyan: We live in a society
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Jhyan: No bottom text
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Neo: ?
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Jhyan: With the joker
2018/04/25, 21:32 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/25, 21:33 - Neo: Yeah

2018/04/25, 21:33 - Jhyan: How so?
2018/04/25, 21:33 - Neo: When did you first see it
2018/04/25, 21:33 - Jhyan: Don't know
2018/04/25, 21:34 - Jhyan: So
2018/04/25, 21:34 - Neo: Really?
2018/04/25, 21:34 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/25, 21:34 - Jhyan: Why would I know when I first saw it
2018/04/25, 21:34 - Jhyan: Probably whenever it appeared on Reddit
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Jhyan: But I don't know
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Neo: it's a meme you enjoy no?
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Neo: The meme is from the beginning of the year
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Jhyan: Well I don't know when I first saw it
2018/04/25, 21:35 - Neo: I personally didn't enjoy it
2018/04/25, 21:36 - Jhyan: This is so Espionage Act of 1917
Can we hit EU Fishing Quotas?
2018/04/25, 21:37 - Jhyan: Can I please sleep now
2018/04/25, 21:37 - Jhyan: I only slept like 3-5 hours every day for the past month, with some of it in the daylight

2018/04/29, 10:05 - Neo: It's a free demo
2018/04/29, 10:05 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/29, 10:05 - Jhyan: I don't want to download it though
2018/04/29, 10:05 - Jhyan: I'll get it some other time
2018/04/29, 10:05 - Neo: Why
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: Coz I downloaded Star Citizen
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: And I might have to do it again
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: And I don't want to get throttled
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Neo: Oh
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: It's only 2 gb
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Neo: Lmao
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: Then I'll get it
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: Well 3
2018/04/29, 10:06 - Jhyan: But still
2018/04/29, 10:07 - Jhyan: Shit Lemme get it
2018/04/29, 10:07 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/29, 10:07 - Neo: Worst comes to worst you can do it over night
2018/04/29, 10:08 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/29, 10:09 - Jhyan: Star Citizen is crashing
2018/04/29, 10:09 - Neo: It's really shitty though
2018/04/29, 10:09 - Jhyan: And nobody else has the same specific error
2018/04/29, 10:09 - Neo: Legit 2p minutes of gameplay
2018/04/29, 10:10 - Neo: Oof
2018/04/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: That and the nature of the error leads me to believe that I messed up the download
2018/04/29, 10:10 - Neo: Delete download
2018/04/29, 10:10 - Neo: Redownload
2018/04/29, 10:10 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/04/29, 10:11 - Neo: Always the solution
2018/04/29, 10:11 - Jhyan: I just don't want to wait again
2018/04/29, 10:12 - Neo: That's what u do all the time
2018/04/29, 10:12 - Neo: I've done it twice
2018/04/29, 10:13 - Jhyan: When
2018/04/29, 10:13 - Jhyan: For what
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Neo: A system update and when A Way Out wasn't working I just replayed the first part after deleting and redownload
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Jhyan: And?
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Neo: A Way Out was a while ago
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Jhyan: Another one?
2018/04/29, 10:15 - Neo: And the system update was last week
2018/04/29, 10:16 - Neo: No as soon as A Way Out came out
2018/04/29, 10:16 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/04/29, 11:51 - Jhyan: The power also went out in the middle of the download
2018/04/29, 11:51 - Jhyan: During the night
2018/04/29, 11:52 - Jhyan: So I'm actually pretty sure that it was a bad download that caused it
2018/04/29, 11:52 - Jhyan: And a reinstall will fix it
2018/04/29, 12:13 - Neo: Yeah
2018/04/29, 12:13 - Neo: That works extremely well
2018/04/29, 13:02 - Jhyan: Wanna see my surreal meme

2018/04/30, 14:07 - Jhyan: I had typed it and sent it before you said anything
2018/04/30, 14:07 - Jhyan: But your internet didn't let it go through
2018/04/30, 14:07 - Neo: What no
2018/04/30, 14:07 - Jhyan: So it looked like you persuaded me

2018/04/30, 14:09 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/04/30, 14:09 - Neo: Ok
2018/04/30, 14:10 - Jhyan: I can't prove it because the timestamp was in the same minute

2018/04/30, 14:11 - Jhyan: Yes

2018/05/01, 21:12 - Neo: this is how you save enerrrgy
2018/05/01, 21:12 - Jhyan: He doesn't even resemble me
2018/05/01, 21:12 - Jhyan: You could've picked someone who looked like me
2018/05/01, 21:12 - Jhyan: Or is it what he does
2018/05/01, 21:12 - Neo: You do
2018/05/01, 21:12 - Jhyan: No I don't
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Jhyan: Look at his hair
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Neo: You have the same sense of humour
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Jhyan: And his face structure is different
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Jhyan: What kind of humor
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Neo: And you look the same
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Jhyan: Give me an example from one of his jokes
2018/05/01, 21:13 - Neo: Retarded
2018/05/01, 21:14 - Jhyan: Are you illiterate
2018/05/01, 21:14 - Jhyan: Don't play this game

2018/05/01, 21:15 - Neo: Oof
2018/05/01, 21:16 - Jhyan: So what are his jokes
2018/05/01, 21:16 - Neo: His videos
2018/05/01, 21:16 - Neo: Are the jokes
2018/05/01, 21:16 - Jhyan: I'm too lazy to watch it
2018/05/01, 21:17 - Neo: Same lol
2018/05/01, 21:17 - Jhyan: But you watched him?
2018/05/01, 21:17 - Jhyan: Ok cool bye
2018/05/01, 21:18 - Neo: Yeah and already forgot he's not a favourite youtuber or anything
2018/05/01, 21:18 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/01, 21:18 - Neo: Only caught my eye because he looks like you
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Jhyan: How
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Jhyan: His face is thinner
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Jhyan: It has a different structure
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Neo: I think i said it already
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Jhyan: His hair is straight and matted
2018/05/01, 21:19 - Neo: You look familiar
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Jhyan: His eyebrows are different
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Jhyan: His nose is different
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Jhyan: He is more pale
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Neo: No
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Neo: Well maybe in the video you watched
2018/05/01, 21:20 - Jhyan: His lips are smaller
2018/05/01, 21:21 - Neo: Yeah but there are a few similarities
2018/05/01, 21:21 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/01, 21:22 - Neo: Yeah
2018/05/01, 21:22 - Jhyan: You look like Blendin Blandin then
2018/05/01, 21:22 - Jhyan: Checkmate
2018/05/01, 21:22 - Neo: Idk who that is
2018/05/01, 21:22 - Jhyan: Search him you'll recognize
2018/05/01, 21:24 - Neo: Oh the guy from gravity falls
2018/05/01, 21:24 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/05/01, 21:24 - Neo: Sophie?
2018/05/01, 21:24 - Jhyan: What
2018/05/01, 21:25 - Jhyan: Sophie?
2018/05/01, 21:25 - Neo: Yeah you get offended so easily I'd guess you're Sophie
2018/05/01, 21:26 - Jhyan: Wait what was I offended about the time before this
2018/05/01, 21:26 - Neo: Idk lol
2018/05/01, 21:26 - Neo: Thought I was illiterate
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Jhyan: No
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Jhyan: That isn't offended
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Jhyan: That's because I was annoyed you were taking so long
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Jhyan: You didn't launch an offense on me to cause that
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Jhyan: And I wasn't offended
2018/05/01, 21:27 - Neo: I wasn't referring to that
2018/05/01, 21:28 - Neo: And you've sent more messages in this conversation than me
2018/05/01, 21:28 - Jhyan: You are very slacking when it comes to giving information that I asked for on text
2018/05/01, 21:28 - Jhyan: That doesn't mean I'm offended
2018/05/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: So I adjust how much I push, added to the fact that you are not easily offensible
2018/05/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: So I have the ability to do that
2018/05/01, 21:29 - Neo: I mean a defensive person would send more messages than a not sjruc
2018/05/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: Also I suddenly doubted and forgot that Sophie was her name
2018/05/01, 21:30 - Jhyan: There are many other causes, I do this on other chats when they haven't said anything to cause me to be defensive
2018/05/01, 21:30 - Neo: Besides you and Gatis have similarities
2018/05/01, 21:30 - Jhyan: I had to look for her in my contacts to double check
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Jhyan: And then I was still slightly unbelieving
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Neo: That says more than you'd think
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Jhyan: It was weird
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Jhyan: How so?
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Neo: Agh
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Jhyan: What
2018/05/01, 21:31 - Neo: Just use your brain
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Neo: Think about it
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: I'm not defending
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: By saying that
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Neo: What
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: Well I am
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: But it's not the main point
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: I wanted you to understand why you shouldn't be confident with statements like that
2018/05/01, 21:32 - Neo: This was an attempt to offend me right
2018/05/01, 21:33 - Jhyan: Because you didn't have enough material to make a claim with high accuracy
2018/05/01, 21:33 - Neo: You aren't even answering my question
2018/05/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: No it was to show how vague "a few similarities" is
2018/05/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: I was typing
2018/05/01, 21:34 - Neo: Well it still took a while and I didn't really notice
2018/05/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: And there's a difference between easily offended and easily defensive
2018/05/01, 21:35 - Jhyan: Well it was impossible to type faster
2018/05/01, 21:35 - Neo: Uhuh
2018/05/01, 21:35 - Neo: Sure
2018/05/01, 21:35 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/01, 21:35 - Jhyan: Goodnight buddy boi
2018/05/01, 21:36 - Neo: Gn sophie
2018/05/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: There's nothing wrong with Sophie in the way that you are trying to say so this doesn't achieve anything
2018/05/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: Can I sleep now
2018/05/01, 21:38 - Neo: That's your own choice
2018/05/01, 21:39 - Neo: Self evidently, you take jokes in the same way
2018/05/01, 21:40 - Jhyan: Сука блят Ⓜ8⃣0⃣

2018/05/04, 20:12 - Jhyan: Have you watched Infinity War
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Neo: Yeah
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Neo: No but Dominic asked me if I wanted to watch it with him
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Jhyan: Cool
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Jhyan: Go watch it with him
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Neo: And we agreed to watch it tomorrow
2018/05/04, 20:12 - Neo: But we can all go

2018/05/04, 20:14 - Neo: What
2018/05/04, 20:14 - Neo: So you don't even know if you can
2018/05/04, 20:14 - Jhyan: No I can
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Jhyan: But are you allowed to just invite me like that
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Neo: What
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Neo: Who cares
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Jhyan: What's the details
2018/05/04, 20:15 - Neo: Didn't know Dominic owned the place lol
2018/05/04, 20:16 - Jhyan: Well when I asked Sebastian he said he'll ask them
2018/05/04, 20:16 - Jhyan: So I assumed that was how it worked
2018/05/04, 20:16 - Jhyan: But nvm now
2018/05/04, 20:18 - Jhyan: Just tell them you invited me aswell
2018/05/04, 20:18 - Jhyan: And this
2018/05/04, 20:18 - Neo: Ugh no biggie
2018/05/04, 20:19 - Neo: I barely know but you Giume and I are going tomorrow
2018/05/04, 20:19 - Jhyan: Well
2018/05/04, 20:19 - Jhyan: So I'll guessing it's on Jupiter right
2018/05/04, 20:19 - Jhyan: My mom is not gonna like this
2018/05/04, 20:21 - Neo: I don't like it lol
2018/05/04, 20:22 - Jhyan: Can I please have details
2018/05/04, 20:22 - Jhyan: Do you not know anything at all
2018/05/04, 20:23 - Neo: The movie we want to watch is at 5
2018/05/04, 20:23 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/04, 20:23 - Neo: I said we could meet up at 3
2018/05/04, 20:23 - Neo: And bla bla
2018/05/04, 20:24 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/05/04, 20:24 - Jhyan: Can I come with you then
2018/05/04, 20:27 - Neo: That wasn't the plan?
2018/05/04, 20:27 - Neo: Lmao
2018/05/04, 20:27 - Jhyan: Ok that's the plan
2018/05/04, 20:27 - Neo: Ye
2018/05/04, 20:29 - Jhyan: Just make sure he knows I'm coming
2018/05/04, 20:30 - Neo: Why
2018/05/04, 20:30 - Jhyan: Because it gives him the option to say know
2018/05/04, 20:31 - Neo: There are nine other people
2018/05/04, 20:31 - Jhyan: Ok listen
2018/05/04, 20:36 - Jhyan: Nvm
2018/05/04, 20:36 - Jhyan: Just do whatever you think will work
2018/05/04, 20:36 - Jhyan: And if he complains or says anything about me being there afterwards tell me so I can avoid a repeat in future
2018/05/04, 20:37 - Neo: Omf
2018/05/04, 20:37 - Jhyan: And don't mock me
2018/05/04, 20:37 - Neo: You guys aren't nine
2018/05/04, 20:37 - Neo: Can you stop being a baby about what happened 4 years ago
2018/05/04, 20:38 - Jhyan: This isn't age specific, it happens in adult environments often
2018/05/04, 20:38 - Jhyan: It's not about they
2018/05/04, 20:38 - Jhyan: *that
2018/05/04, 20:38 - Jhyan: At least not entirely
2018/05/04, 20:39 - Neo: Where two people hate each other because they pushed each other when they were 11
2018/05/04, 20:39 - Jhyan: No
2018/05/04, 20:39 - Neo: Was it about
2018/05/04, 20:41 - Jhyan: I'm not seen as very fun to hang out with by the rest of the people, and Dominic, being a good host, will value the happiness of many, and if he can't, he will not be happy about it, and neither will those people.
2018/05/04, 20:42 - Neo: Then don't be a drag
2018/05/04, 20:43 - Jhyan: I'm 94% introverted, I'm pretty sure I will be seen as a tag-along
2018/05/04, 20:45 - Jhyan: But having the insurance of the permission of the host gives them less of an argument, and it also means that there's 1 extra person, adding up to 5 people who are fine with me joining with proof, which means I'm not as much of an extra person.
2018/05/04, 20:45 - Jhyan: So it will work out
2018/05/04, 20:45 - Jhyan: And if he says no, it will be an easy way to get out of a problem before it happens
2018/05/04, 20:46 - Jhyan: Like a warning when your engine is getting too hot
2018/05/04, 20:52 - Jhyan: I don't drag on purpose, I'm just not that interesting to those people, being unsociable, a "nerd", non-talkative,  less of a reckless teenager and not very relatable in general. (This applies not only to the other people coming with).
2018/05/04, 20:54 - Jhyan: And I'm not saying that's everyone what, because I only know 7/9 of the people that are coming, but it's a likely assumption.
2018/05/04, 20:54 - Jhyan: Based on the people I know of
2018/05/04, 20:54 - Jhyan: Don't tell me I worry too much
2018/05/04, 20:54 - Jhyan: I have one more question
2018/05/04, 20:55 - Jhyan: To the extent of your knowledge, is Tamara coming aswell?
2018/05/04, 21:28 - Neo: Why lol
2018/05/04, 21:28 - Neo: Ooo
2018/05/04, 22:03 - Jhyan: Because
2018/05/04, 22:03 - Jhyan: I know she's watching Infinity War this weekend
2018/05/04, 22:05 - Jhyan: And we're on unfortunate terms
2018/05/04, 22:08 - Jhyan: You could say it wouldn't go down so smoothly for either of us if we were to meet outside of school, specifically, and especially,  on this weekend watching Infinity War.
2018/05/04, 22:09 - Jhyan: So can you say yes, or tell me that you don't know
2018/05/05, 06:44 - Neo: I really don't think so
2018/05/05, 06:45 - Neo: Do you want me to ask her?
2018/05/05, 06:46 - Neo: And to ease your tensity everyone said yes you can come
2018/05/05, 08:51 - Jhyan: No
2018/05/05, 08:52 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/05, 08:55 - Jhyan: So what's the plan
2018/05/05, 08:55 - Jhyan: You can come past my house on the way there and I can join you
2018/05/05, 08:56 - Jhyan: Or I could come to your house and then we could go from there
2018/05/05, 08:56 - Neo: I thought u would come at 1 then set everything up and go
2018/05/05, 08:56 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/05, 08:56 - Jhyan: I might be able to do that
2018/05/05, 08:57 - Neo: Sure
2018/05/05, 08:57 - Jhyan: Lemme check
2018/05/05, 08:59 - Jhyan: Can you ask him where it is
2018/05/05, 09:00 - Neo: What
2018/05/05, 09:00 - Neo: Eastgate
2018/05/05, 09:00 - Jhyan: My mom wants to know
2018/05/05, 09:00 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/05/05, 09:00 - Jhyan: Cool
2018/05/05, 09:01 - Neo: Strange how I didn't mention this to you
2018/05/05, 09:01 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/05/05, 09:01 - Jhyan: Especially because I asked 🤔🤔
2018/05/05, 09:01 - Jhyan: Earlier even

2018/05/26, 23:12 - Neo: Oh
2018/05/26, 23:12 - Neo: You can't get photoshop on your phone
2018/05/26, 23:13 - Jhyan: There's a mobile app, but it's like Snapseed
2018/05/26, 23:13 - Jhyan: It's easy and quick edits
2018/05/26, 23:13 - Jhyan: Like a bicycle compared to a motorbike

2018/05/26, 23:17 - Jhyan: Idk why I said that
2018/05/26, 23:17 - Jhyan: Just take it as useless trivia coz that's what it is really
2018/05/26, 23:17 - Jhyan: You can't do anything with it

2018/06/10, 20:20 - Jhyan: Unravel 2?
2018/06/10, 20:20 - Jhyan: No
2018/06/10, 20:20 - Neo: *screams*
2018/06/10, 20:20 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/06/10, 20:20 - Neo: **REEEEE**
2018/06/10, 20:21 - Jhyan: 9k
2018/06/10, 20:21 - Neo: SoS
2018/06/10, 20:21 - Neo: Looks
2018/06/10, 20:21 - Neo: Nice
2018/06/10, 20:21 - Neo: EA looks like they're turning around
2018/06/10, 20:22 - Neo: And want to sweep all the theft business under the rug
2018/06/10, 20:22 - Jhyan: Nah
2018/06/10, 20:22 - Jhyan: Doubt it
2018/06/10, 20:22 - Neo: C'mon no loot boxes
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Neo: More free content
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Jhyan: But it's a singleplayer game
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Neo: What
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Neo: SoS
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Jhyan: Also unless they let a good singleplayer Star Wars game happen I'm not trusting them
2018/06/10, 20:23 - Neo: They are making a new star wars
2018/06/10, 20:24 - Neo: I'm not too interested in that though
2018/06/10, 20:24 - Jhyan: It's multiplayer so shut up
2018/06/10, 20:24 - Neo: Oh
2018/06/10, 20:24 - Jhyan: They already shut down the singleplayer one that was supposed to happen
2018/06/10, 20:25 - Neo: Ouch
2018/06/10, 20:25 - Jhyan: Because "it didn't appeal to players and wouldn't be continuously enjoyable"
2018/06/10, 20:25 - Jhyan: Brb
2018/06/10, 20:25 - Neo: Don't you enjoy co-op
2018/06/10, 20:25 - Neo: Okilly dokilly
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Jhyan: Co-op
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Jhyan: Not massively multiplayer
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Neo: I prefer Co-op
Most of the games they're pumping out seem to be multiplayer anyways
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Neo: Yeah
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/10, 20:26 - Neo: There isn't going to be pvp at launch in Anthem
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Jhyan: But I actually prefer singleplayer games the most
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Neo: Unravel is Co op only
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Neo: 2 player only
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Jhyan: No
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Jhyan: That's shit
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Neo: SoS looks like your type of game
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Jhyan: The first one was a really good singleplayer exosome
2018/06/10, 20:27 - Jhyan: *experience
2018/06/10, 20:28 - Neo: Yeah I said Unravel 2  looks like a down grade
2018/06/10, 20:28 - Jhyan: It's fucked up
2018/06/10, 20:29 - Jhyan: The first one was good BECAUSE it was more of art than a game
2018/06/10, 20:29 - Jhyan: Like limbo
2018/06/10, 20:29 - Jhyan: Or INSIDE
2018/06/10, 20:30 - Neo: Besides unravel is one of those games you'd play without saying anything now imagine not saying anything whilst sitting next to someone
2018/06/10, 20:30 - Neo: Imagine sharing a keyboard
2018/06/10, 20:31 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/06/10, 20:31 - Jhyan: Exactly
2018/06/10, 20:31 - Neo: You know those multiplayer browser games
2018/06/10, 20:32 - Neo: Muhl-tie 
Or
Muhl-T

2018/06/10, 20:51 - Neo: Browser games
2018/06/10, 20:52 - Neo: Omg

2018/06/10, 20:54 - Neo: Oh a coin mint
2018/06/10, 20:55 - Jhyan: Anyway

2018/06/11, 11:14 - Jhyan: And Anthem
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Neo: Looks like a downgrade
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Jhyan: Look at The Elder Scrolls VI
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Jhyan: It was confirmed
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Neo: Oh yeah
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Jhyan: You are some bigot
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Neo: But I didn't see all of it
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Jhyan: AND you didn't tell me
2018/06/11, 11:14 - Neo: And it was a short teaser anyways
2018/06/11, 11:15 - Jhyan: Sorry
2018/06/11, 11:15 - Neo: O
2018/06/11, 11:15 - Neo: Fallout 76 is online only
2018/06/11, 11:15 - Neo: We can play together (possibly)
2018/06/11, 11:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 11:16 - Jhyan: That would be good
2018/06/11, 11:16 - Jhyan: But I wouldn't get it on PS4
2018/06/11, 11:16 - Neo: It is
2018/06/11, 11:16 - Jhyan: So
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Neo: And it's coming out in November
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Neo: Ik
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Neo: I hope its cross platform
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Jhyan: Nope
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Neo: It isn't?
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Jhyan: They can't do that fairly with anything related to aiming and shooting
2018/06/11, 11:17 - Neo: But it's Co op
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Jhyan: Welp
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Jhyan: I'll play it with someone else
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Neo: And if you can afford the game you can afford a keyboard+mouse/controller
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Jhyan: Jk
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Jhyan: I'll see
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Neo: I wanna get it
2018/06/11, 11:18 - Jhyan: That's not what I meant
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Neo: Yeah I know
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Jhyan: Oh it's only 2 people
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Neo: It's for four people
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Neo: At a time
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/11, 11:19 - Jhyan: Ok maybe it will be then
2018/06/11, 11:20 - Jhyan: They can do that then
2018/06/11, 11:20 - Jhyan: It's a lot less risky
2018/06/11, 11:20 - Jhyan: If it's just a couple of friends
2018/06/11, 11:20 - Jhyan: I thought it was massively multiplayer
2018/06/11, 11:21 - Jhyan: Hopefully then
2018/06/11, 11:21 - Jhyan: But I'm not going to stoop to your level because you had your chance to get a PC
2018/06/11, 11:21 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Jhyan: What's that
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Neo: Yeah there's the possibility we might not play together
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Jhyan: I'm player 4 I take it?
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Neo: No it's the trailer
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Jhyan: The one with the most health
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/11, 11:22 - Neo: Yeah the hp bar belongs to the forth player
2018/06/11, 11:23 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 11:23 - Neo: They even have avatars
2018/06/11, 11:27 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 11:40 - Neo: We heard you were so excited about the first division, so guess what we did
2018/06/11, 11:40 - Neo: That's right another division game
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: Maybe they'll do it right
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Neo: I'm gonna give them a chance
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: I wanted to get The Division
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: But it sucked
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Neo: Yeah like with WATCH dogs
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Neo: Watch Dogs
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Jhyan: and guess why?
2018/06/11, 11:41 - Neo: They downgraded it
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Jhyan: BECAUSE OF YOU PEASANTS
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Neo: False advertisement
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Jhyan: AND WATCHDOGS, YES
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Neo: I didn't eve have a PS4 at that time
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Jhyan: gtg eat
2018/06/11, 11:42 - Neo: Okilly
2018/06/11, 15:27 - Jhyan: I wanna get Anthem though
2018/06/11, 15:27 - Neo: Yeah it looks promising
2018/06/11, 15:27 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 15:28 - Jhyan: Apparently there no lootboxes
2018/06/11, 15:28 - Neo: If you preorder  it on ps4 you get access to the demos
2018/06/11, 15:28 - Jhyan: And the microtransactions are just for cosmetic stuff
2018/06/11, 15:28 - Neo: Possibly DLCs too actually
2018/06/11, 15:29 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/06/11, 15:29 - Jhyan: But that's not as shit at least
2018/06/11, 15:31 - Jhyan: Did you get Detroit or God of War btw
2018/06/11, 16:01 - Neo: No
2018/06/11, 18:07 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/06/11, 22:08 - Jhyan: Beyond Good and Evil 2
2018/06/11, 22:08 - Jhyan: They're doing a thing for it now
2018/06/11, 22:30 - Jhyan: I'm looking at the thing for the division 2
2018/06/11, 22:30 - Jhyan: And I was jokingly making a comment about how the graphics were move as I had thought it was a live action promotion
2018/06/11, 22:30 - Jhyan: But I realized it was in fact rendered
2018/06/12, 06:50 - Neo: I didn't see much of Division
2018/06/12, 07:10 - Neo: What do you think is gonna happen to VATS in fallout

2018/06/12, 18:53 - Neo: How
2018/06/12, 18:54 - Jhyan: Also I'm watching actual gameplay by someone outside any studio, so it's almost impossible that they'll scale the graphics down like last time

2018/06/12, 19:23 - Jhyan: Why is it divided by 3
2018/06/12, 19:23 - Jhyan: Also the price for Anthem is wrong

2018/06/12, 19:36 - Jhyan: Why
2018/06/12, 19:38 - Jhyan: What do you think about Starfield

2018/06/12, 19:38 - Jhyan: Even though we've seen nothing
2018/06/12, 19:38 - Neo: Idk it doesn't seem that eye-catching
2018/06/12, 19:38 - Jhyan: Yeah it looks like they are  gonns execute whatever it is really well
2018/06/12, 19:38 - Neo: Looks like it belongs on psp or psvita

2018/06/12, 20:58 - Neo: But they kept pushing the release date
2018/06/12, 20:58 - Neo: Because of the staff
2018/06/12, 20:58 - Jhyan: They couldn't have been small and pulled off some of the best AAA games
2018/06/12, 20:59 - Neo: I'm pretty sure
2018/06/12, 20:59 - Neo: Send link for dis pls
2018/06/12, 21:01 - Jhyan: I will in a sec

2018/06/12, 21:02 - Jhyan: But they ARE talking about the game
2018/06/12, 21:02 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arY6lepNdzU
2018/06/12, 21:26 - Neo: Nintendo's stream was trash
2018/06/12, 21:26 - Neo: Maybe Hollow Knight
2018/06/12, 21:26 - Jhyan: Seems like it
2018/06/12, 21:26 - Neo: But that looks like a mobile game tbh
2018/06/12, 21:59 - Jhyan: Apparently it's really good
2018/06/12, 21:59 - Jhyan: Sorry for the absence I had to do something
2018/06/13, 07:19 - Neo: An FPS or A FPS
2018/06/13, 07:23 - Jhyan: An
2018/06/13, 07:23 - Neo: Thank you
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Jhyan: But A for the unabreviated

2018/06/13, 07:24 - Neo: Logan
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Jhyan: For the abbreviated
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Jhyan: What a retard
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Neo: Yeah
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Jhyan: I bet he says jiff
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Jhyan: For gif
2018/06/13, 07:24 - Neo: Lmao that's more subjective though
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Jhyan: No it's not
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Neo: Yeah compared to the FPS matter it is
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Jhyan: There are rules in English stating that the g is hard
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Neo: Oh
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Jhyan: No it's not
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Neo: Then if they are then I guess so
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Jhyan: Because in the acronym, the g follows the word it stands for
2018/06/13, 07:25 - Jhyan: And graphics is a hard g
2018/06/13, 07:26 - Neo: Well damn
2018/06/13, 15:49 - Neo: Might be cross platform for Anthem
2018/06/13, 16:39 - Neo: And do you know games on Steam are cheaper than games on the PlayStation Store
2018/06/13, 16:39 - Jhyan: You are very optimistic
2018/06/13, 16:39 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/06/13, 16:41 - Neo: They said most likely
2018/06/13, 16:41 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/06/13, 16:42 - Neo: PC uses steam
PlayStaton uses PlayStation Store
What does Xbox use
2018/06/13, 16:43 - Jhyan: I don't know
2018/06/13, 16:43 - Jhyan: Google it
2018/06/13, 16:45 - Neo: Microsoft store
2018/06/13, 16:45 - Neo: Microsoft can be used describe pen15

2018/06/13, 20:06 - Jhyan: Idk
2018/06/13, 20:06 - Jhyan: But it probably won't make a difference because it's EA
2018/06/13, 20:07 - Neo: Yeah

2018/06/14, 15:47 - Jhyan: But if you say it's fine
2018/06/14, 15:47 - Jhyan: Then it's fine

2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: *basically
2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: I have lots of money in the game
2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: And a great ship
2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: So yeah
2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: That's a good idea
2018/07/26, 12:21 - Jhyan: I really like that they've redeemed themselves aswell
2018/07/26, 12:22 - Jhyan: And even if the game wasn't good now (because it is), they still deserve the purchase for trying even though they failed
2018/07/26, 12:23 - Neo: Too bad they lost a bit of the original fanbase
2018/07/26, 12:24 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/07/26, 12:24 - Jhyan: I'm still there though
2018/07/26, 12:24 - Neo: I don't think so
2018/07/26, 12:25 - Neo: You deserve a purchase if you make a good game
2018/07/26, 12:25 - Jhyan: Yeah but they kept trying to make a good game despite the fact that they did it wrong on release
2018/07/26, 12:27 - Neo: It's their fault for lying about the game
2018/07/26, 12:28 - Neo: Or they should have said it wasn't going to be there during initial release
2018/07/26, 12:28 - Jhyan: Yeah but they tried to make it up
2018/07/26, 12:28 - Jhyan: Yeah at least
2018/07/26, 12:28 - Neo: Yeah I guess
2018/07/26, 12:29 - Neo: Yeah they dud because look now in compelled to get the game so by my standards they tried hard enough
2018/07/26, 12:29 - Jhyan: Yeah ok
2018/07/26, 12:29 - Neo: Did try hard enough
2018/07/26, 12:30 - Jhyan: Well we agree on the final result anyway

2018/07/26, 13:57 - Neo: Yeah
2018/07/26, 14:05 - Jhyan: Um
2018/07/26, 14:05 - Jhyan: Nameless
2018/07/27, 06:04 - Neo: Fortnite is way better than pubg
2018/07/27, 06:04 - Neo: Pubg barely has any server maintenance
2018/07/27, 06:04 - Neo: And is extremely glitchy
2018/07/27, 09:25 - Jhyan: You don't even know that
2018/07/27, 09:25 - Jhyan: I have the game
2018/07/27, 09:27 - Jhyan: So I have No Man's Sky now
2018/07/27, 09:27 - Jhyan: It's pretty good
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Neo: Okay
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Neo: No I played pubg on Logan's xbo
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Neo: And it's super glitchy
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Jhyan: Xbox is known for being glitchy
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Neo: What no
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Jhyan: I mean the PUBG version on Xbox
2018/07/27, 09:30 - Neo: Yeah I get its worse on console but still
2018/07/27, 09:31 - Jhyan: Sorry that was ambiguous
2018/07/27, 09:31 - Neo: Yeah yeah
2018/07/27, 09:31 - Neo: Compare Fortnite to PUBG
2018/07/27, 09:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/07/27, 09:31 - Jhyan: I have
2018/07/27, 09:32 - Neo: On XBO
2018/07/27, 09:32 - Neo: Fortnite's way better
2018/07/27, 09:32 - Jhyan: Yes, on Xbox it's reasonable to say Fortnite is better
2018/07/27, 09:35 - Neo: Besides the people who work on pubg don't care about the game as much as the people who work on fortnite
2018/07/27, 09:35 - Jhyan: No you're wrong there buddy
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Jhyan: Epic Games gives more attention, yes, but it's because their game is a money making machine
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Neo: Pubg used to be in beta and it was a broken
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Neo: Ofc it was it was in beta
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Neo: But it's still a broken game to this day
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Jhyan: No it's not
2018/07/27, 09:36 - Neo: It is
2018/07/27, 09:37 - Jhyan: Nope
2018/07/27, 09:37 - Jhyan: Not for me
2018/07/27, 09:37 - Neo: It's extremely broken
2018/07/27, 09:37 - Jhyan: ...

2018/08/31, 19:57 - Neo: Yeah
2018/08/31, 19:57 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/08/31, 19:57 - Neo: I think that was Giume

2018/08/31, 20:25 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/08/31, 20:25 - Jhyan: It's not like they're likely to delay it
2018/08/31, 20:25 - Jhyan: It's cartoon network itself that's involved with this
2018/08/31, 20:26 - Jhyan: And also they haven't phrased it to seem like they aren't 100% sure
2018/08/31, 20:26 - Jhyan: This isn't games
2018/08/31, 21:04 - Neo: I guess

2018/10/07, 21:08 - Jhyan: I got confused with whatever the sanctuary is called
2018/10/07, 21:09 - Jhyan: But yeah Ra9 is left to us to figure out
2018/10/07, 21:09 - Jhyan: I personally think it's a piece of code that gets written when they deviate or some sort of thing that's a lynchpin in deviation
2018/10/07, 21:10 - Jhyan: Some people think it's a God
2018/10/07, 21:10 - Jhyan: I don't remember that week

2018/10/23, 18:50 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: Thank God it wasn't one of the new ones
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: Or it was the exception to the new ones
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: Because the last season was idiotic
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Neo: Yeah lmao the mother is a really good actor
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: They gave the episodes happy endings
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Neo: Hmm
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: And that ruined the whole thing
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: The whole feel
2018/10/23, 18:51 - Jhyan: They're supposed to be dark

2018/10/23, 18:52 - Jhyan: Yeah but anyway I hope they don't fuck it up next season
2018/10/23, 18:53 - Jhyan: If there is one
2018/10/23, 18:53 - Neo: Yeah
2018/10/23, 18:53 - Jhyan: You should watch the troll face one
2018/10/23, 18:53 - Jhyan: Idk what it's called
2018/10/23, 18:53 - Jhyan: It's the best in theme with the show

2018/10/24, 13:04 - Jhyan: https://entertainment.theonion.com/video-game-blacksmith-struggling-to-compete-with-random-1829940300
2018/10/24, 18:28 - Neo: Weird flex but ok
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: You don't understand
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: Yes
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: I agree
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: That Jessica Jones and Iron fist weren't _that_ good
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: And Luke Cage was good but not anything amazing
2018/10/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: But Daredevil...
2018/10/28, 21:28 - Jhyan: Whoever the team is that works on it are geniuses
2018/10/28, 21:28 - Jhyan: You don't even have to watch it
2018/10/28, 21:29 - Jhyan: But don't say it's bad without doing so
2018/10/28, 21:29 - Jhyan: Although I highly recommend you do, in fact, watch it, because of how utterly ridiculously great it is
2018/10/28, 21:30 - Jhyan: Unless you hate superhero or action or whatever you'll enjoy it
2018/10/29, 06:23 - Neo: I just don't like Netflix adaptations
2018/10/29, 06:23 - Neo: I prefer the originals
2018/10/29, 06:24 - Neo: But I will check it oue
2018/10/29, 06:24 - Neo: Out
2018/10/29, 07:19 - Jhyan: So you would read the comics?
2018/10/29, 07:19 - Jhyan: Because that's the original
2018/10/29, 07:35 - Neo: Yeah but the other three or two shows are in the same position
2018/10/29, 07:38 - Jhyan: Of not doing justice to the original (comics)?
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Neo: Wot
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Neo: I'm talking about Jessica Jones
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Neo: And Iron Fist
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Neo: And Luke Cage
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/10/29, 07:39 - Jhyan: You say they have the problem of being bad adaptations
2018/10/29, 08:50 - Neo: Netflix adaptations have a bed reputation
2018/10/29, 08:50 - Neo: Bleach, Death Note, etc
2018/10/29, 08:50 - Jhyan: But that's usually when it is an adaptation of another thing
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Jhyan: That's an adaptation of the anime
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Neo: ?
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Jhyan: Comics and manga don't count
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Jhyan: They are too direct
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Neo: ALL ADAPTATIONS
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Neo: The ones I've seen
2018/10/29, 08:51 - Jhyan: Their normal adaptations don't have a bad reputation like their anime adaptations
2018/10/29, 08:52 - Jhyan: Maybe it's your judgement
2018/10/29, 08:52 - Neo: What are you saying
2018/10/29, 08:52 - Jhyan: But the mainstream thinking is not that all of their adaptations are bad
2018/10/29, 08:52 - Jhyan: It's only the ones that are based on source material that was already a media
2018/10/29, 08:53 - Neo: All of the ones I've seen are bad
2018/10/29, 08:53 - Jhyan: Mostly anime
2018/10/29, 08:53 - Jhyan: But you've seen anime adaptations
2018/10/29, 08:53 - Neo: But Luke Cage is terrible
2018/10/29, 08:53 - Neo: So is Iron Fist
2018/10/29, 08:54 - Jhyan: Yeah but there terrible rather for being badly made shows, not badly made adaptations
2018/10/29, 08:54 - Jhyan: Like if Breaking Bad was bad then it wouldn't be a bad adaptation
2018/10/29, 08:55 - Jhyan: It's not bad as a cause of a failure to adapt it well is what I'm saying
2018/10/29, 17:31 - Neo: Yeah you have a point
2018/10/29, 17:32 - Neo: But if a large majority of a group do something in common then it's very natural to assume the rest does the same thing
2018/10/29, 17:32 - Neo: Like majority of white people are white
2018/10/29, 17:33 - Jhyan: Ok
2018/10/29, 17:33 - Jhyan: I get it
2018/10/29, 17:33 - Neo: Yeah

2018/11/01, 15:24 - Jhyan: They invented jet packs
2018/11/01, 15:24 - Jhyan: Take a look at @ludi85's Tweet: https://twitter.com/ludi85/status/1052133956286644224?s=08
2018/11/01, 15:24 - Jhyan: My mom was one of those people standing there
2018/11/01, 19:36 - Neo: Cool
2018/11/01, 19:36 - Neo: Dare devil is really good
2018/11/01, 19:36 - Jhyan: Yeah
2018/11/01, 19:36 - Jhyan: I know
2018/11/02, 23:31 - Jhyan: If you're interested I think The Punisher is also good enough for you to enjoy
2018/11/02, 23:31 - Jhyan: It's not anywhere near the masterpiece Daredevil has proven itself to be, but it's still really good in my eyes
2018/11/02, 23:31 - Jhyan: But beware, the first two episodes are slow
2018/11/04, 08:05 - Neo: It looks terrible
2018/11/04, 08:05 - Neo: Make a plug with naked hairy legs
2018/11/04, 08:17 - Jhyan: No
2018/11/04, 09:22 - Neo: You can call him Orth
2018/11/04, 09:22 - Jhyan: It's too hard
2018/11/04, 09:23 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2018/11/04, 17:15 - Jhyan: Amazo
2018/11/04, 18:42 - Neo: Yrth

2018/11/14, 18:56 - Neo: How far are you
2018/11/17, 20:13 - Jhyan: Damn I was typing a message to this and forgot to send it
2018/11/17, 20:13 - Jhyan: I'm like finished season 1
2018/11/17, 20:13 - Jhyan: Have you seen Hitman 2

2018/11/17, 22:22 - Jhyan: Oh
2018/11/17, 22:22 - Jhyan: It looks good
2018/11/21, 12:21 - Neo: Hit man's graphics are terrible
2018/11/21, 12:22 - Jhyan: What
2018/11/21, 12:22 - Jhyan: Which one
2018/11/21, 12:24 - Jhyan: Also I don't see a problem with it, give me examples
2018/11/21, 15:06 - Neo: They're not current gen standards
2018/11/21, 15:07 - Jhyan: What are current gen standards
2018/11/21, 15:07 - Jhyan: And why do you say so
2018/11/21, 15:13 - Neo: Compare its gameplay to another game that came out recently
2018/11/21, 15:14 - Jhyan: I assume you mean a sample of footage
2018/11/21, 15:14 - Jhyan: Not the actual gameplay
2018/11/21, 15:14 - Jhyan: Because gameplay has nothing to do with graphics
2018/11/21, 16:42 - Neo: The graphics from the gameplay I saw
2018/11/21, 16:43 - Jhyan: Ok but try to point out what's bad about it
2018/11/21, 16:44 - Jhyan: Maybe I'll see it after it's mentioned
2018/11/21, 16:45 - Neo: No it just isn't as good as the other titles from this year
2018/11/21, 16:45 - Jhyan: I think it is
2018/11/21, 17:42 - Neo: Alex says he'll fetch it from us so you just have to bring it back
2018/11/21, 17:43 - Jhyan: What

2019/03/07, 19:24 - Jhyan: Idk
2019/03/07, 19:24 - Jhyan: They give us topics
2019/03/07, 19:25 - Jhyan: Like "This house believes that the body positivity movement leads to unhealthy lifestyles"
2019/03/07, 19:26 - Jhyan: Or "This house would remove VAT on locally produced goods sold in local stores"
2019/03/07, 19:26 - Jhyan: I don't like the ones like this though
2019/03/07, 19:27 - Jhyan: I don't like the ones about laws and economy or whatever coz they're boring
2019/03/07, 19:27 - Neo: Oh yeah
2019/03/07, 19:27 - Neo: So you don't prepare on one
2019/03/07, 19:27 - Jhyan: Like I don't want to argue about why tax should be removed
2019/03/07, 19:28 - Jhyan: No
2019/03/07, 19:28 - Neo: Or research something
2019/03/07, 19:28 - Jhyan: They give it to us an hour before and we use our knowledge
2019/03/07, 19:28 - Jhyan: We can't use the internet
2019/03/07, 19:28 - Neo: What if you don't have any knowledge on the topic
2019/03/07, 19:29 - Jhyan: But we can use stuff we've compiled like worksheets on democracy or something that we've been given in workshops
2019/03/07, 19:29 - Jhyan: Then you leach off of your team
2019/03/07, 19:29 - Jhyan: Or you're screwed
2019/03/07, 19:30 - Jhyan: But you can use this stuff
2019/03/07, 19:30 - Neo: Oh okay
2019/03/07, 19:31 - Neo: Have you ever been asked to do something you don't really understand
2019/03/07, 19:31 - Jhyan: I've only debated in practices
2019/03/07, 19:31 - Jhyan: I was late last time, and it was my first one
2019/03/07, 19:31 - Jhyan: Like a fucking idiot
2019/03/07, 19:31 - Jhyan: But that's another story
2019/03/07, 19:32 - Jhyan: Yeah the VAT one was
2019/03/07, 19:32 - Neo: Ohhh
2019/03/07, 19:32 - Jhyan: I know what VAT is and stuff but not what purpose it serves and stuff
2019/03/07, 19:32 - Neo: Yeh same
2019/03/07, 19:33 - Jhyan: But I knew enough that I could make a point, for example, that the money would go to corrupt government officials and not towards national spending
2019/03/07, 19:33 - Neo: I guess that the higher price would drive customers away
2019/03/07, 19:34 - Jhyan: Oh yeah and we were saying it should be removed
2019/03/07, 19:34 - Neo: Like there couldn't be much reason someone could be shopping for local stuff
2019/03/07, 19:34 - Neo: Other than the costs or supporting local businesses
2019/03/07, 19:35 - Neo: Man irdk
2019/03/07, 19:35 - Jhyan: It means like potatoes grown here or something

2019/04/27, 14:02 - Jhyan: But it'll probably be like 2pm
2019/04/27, 14:03 - Jhyan: The screening hasn't renewed yet so booking is only until Thursday until it renews
2019/04/27, 14:04 - Neo: 2pm today
2019/04/27, 14:05 - Jhyan: No what
2019/04/27, 14:05 - Jhyan: You said it was next week last week
2019/04/27, 14:05 - Jhyan: When I first told you about booking already today was fully booked
2019/04/27, 14:05 - Jhyan: So I said Monday
2019/04/27, 14:06 - Jhyan: And that was the 29th, in two days
2019/04/27, 14:06 - Jhyan: And then you said can't we go the next week
2019/04/27, 14:06 - Jhyan: So we're going next Saturday
2019/04/27, 14:07 - Jhyan: If you didn't mean to cause this it's your fault mate
2019/04/27, 14:08 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/04/27, 14:12 - Neo: Yeah that's what I meant
2019/04/27, 14:12 - Jhyan: So next Saturday then
2019/04/27, 14:12 - Neo: nexg eeej
2019/04/27, 14:12 - Neo: Yeh
2019/04/27, 14:12 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/04/27, 14:13 - Neo: Lol
2019/04/27, 14:13 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/27, 15:03 - Jhyan: Oh yeah and you still have my controller
2019/04/27, 16:46 - Neo: Yah I'm sorry
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: You know Sekiro
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: It isn't that hard right
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: Like it doesn't take countless hours per bossfight
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: Or to progress
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: Right
2019/04/29, 20:12 - Jhyan: Coz people are saying it's really hard and they want an easy mode
2019/04/29, 20:15 - Neo: Uh
2019/04/29, 20:15 - Neo: I think it's hard
2019/04/29, 20:16 - Jhyan: How long does it take to progress through a major boss
2019/04/29, 20:16 - Neo: I'll check how many total hours I have in total I think I'm on the second last boss
2019/04/29, 20:17 - Neo: A major boss could take  hours if you're not too good at the parrying thing
2019/04/29, 20:17 - Jhyan: But would this be an unbiased measure seeing as you haven't played games like this before (as far as I know)
2019/04/29, 20:17 - Jhyan: Multiple weeks?
2019/04/29, 20:17 - Neo: No
2019/04/29, 20:17 - Jhyan: Ok so it's obviously harder than most games
2019/04/29, 20:18 - Neo: Well if you don't have a whole day like the weekend or a public holiday than yah
2019/04/29, 20:18 - Jhyan: But I don't think it should've sparked such a huge debate over difficulty options
2019/04/29, 20:18 - Neo: Like Alex and I are very different
2019/04/29, 20:18 - Neo: But I'd say I'm better at the game considering I started first
2019/04/29, 20:19 - Neo: But he spent the least amount of time on the boss I spent the most
2019/04/29, 20:19 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:19 - Jhyan: That makes sense
2019/04/29, 20:19 - Neo: You know there is a  difficulty option in the form of this curse
2019/04/29, 20:20 - Jhyan: Ok but do you think it should have an easy mode
2019/04/29, 20:20 - Jhyan: It's made by a company that forms their entire legacy on extremely difficult games
2019/04/29, 20:20 - Neo: Giume rung this Bell and I don't know how to take it off and I'm too lazy
2019/04/29, 20:20 - Neo: No no
2019/04/29, 20:21 - Neo: Mainly because I made it too far into the game and seeing a new player finish the game with an easy mode would be disappointing and unfair
2019/04/29, 20:21 - Jhyan: And the creative process that is wasted when they have to add an option other to what it was in the developer's minds
2019/04/29, 20:22 - Neo: Yah I agree that the genre is meant to be like the way it is
2019/04/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: And it doesn't make sense to me
2019/04/29, 20:22 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: The people who want an easy mode
2019/04/29, 20:22 - Jhyan: One of their main arguments is that it would "respect the players"
2019/04/29, 20:23 - Jhyan: But why tf are you buying and playing such a hard game that you knew was gonna be hard to begin with
2019/04/29, 20:23 - Neo: But most of the people asking for an easy mode are game journalists
2019/04/29, 20:23 - Jhyan: And then complaining
2019/04/29, 20:23 - Neo: Yeahh
2019/04/29, 20:23 - Neo: Game journalists opinions should be disregarded
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Neo: Or be taken less seriously
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Jhyan: They're doing it for clicks
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Jhyan: So it's biased
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Neo: Especially since a lot of them are doing it for money
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Jhyan: Idk
2019/04/29, 20:24 - Jhyan: Some games work well with it but in this context it would be distasteful
2019/04/29, 20:25 - Neo: Yea also when I bought the game I didn't think it would be as hard as people say but yah
2019/04/29, 20:25 - Jhyan: Lol
2019/04/29, 20:25 - Jhyan: I've gotten better at Dark Souls since I bought it in 2016
2019/04/29, 20:25 - Jhyan: It used to be ungodly levels of difficult
2019/04/29, 20:25 - Jhyan: But now it's not that bad
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Neo: The only thing I don't like about the game is the grinding part but that's a personal thing
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Neo: Yeah same
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Jhyan: Yeah grinding is annoying for me too
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Neo: Like if I replayed the game it would be Hella ez
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Jhyan: I'm gonna get Sekiro in June
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Jhyan: I think
2019/04/29, 20:26 - Jhyan: When the summer sale happens
2019/04/29, 20:27 - Neo: Giume said he spent 5 hours on a single boss and when you fight a sort of copy of the boss later in the game I beat him without the prosthetics
2019/04/29, 20:27 - Neo: Yah defo
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Jhyan: That's like minor boss level for Dark Souls
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Neo: And it was a mini boss
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Jhyan: Oh damn
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Jhyan: So it is hard then huh
2019/04/29, 20:28 - Neo: Andi think I spend more time on mini bosses than main bosses
2019/04/29, 20:29 - Neo: Yeh
2019/04/29, 20:29 - Jhyan: I really wanted to get it after you let me have a taste but I've been wanting to get DMC 5 for a while now
2019/04/29, 20:29 - Neo: But I think the reason to that was that the mini bosses are supposed to get you in shape and ready for the bigger fights
2019/04/29, 20:29 - Jhyan: I love the combat
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Jhyan: Yeah they're practice
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Neo: Oh I haven't played much attention to it
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Jhyan: So you are better once you get to the real bosses
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Jhyan: What
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Neo: What about MK 11
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Neo: Yeah but that might just be me
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Jhyan: It looks nice enough
2019/04/29, 20:30 - Jhyan: I don't like fighting games
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: I think it's way cheaper on steam than psn
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: Like obviously
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Jhyan: I don't like when there's a billion combos
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: But way cheaper
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: Oh okay
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Jhyan: Especially if it's in sale
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Jhyan: It's 355 for the base game on steam
2019/04/29, 20:31 - Neo: Psh I'll get a PC when I get a job
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Neo: Which may be soon
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Jhyan: You missed your chance when the Pro came out
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Jhyan: Oh?
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Neo: In the December holidays
2019/04/29, 20:32 - Jhyan: Damn
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Neo: I think since I don't really celebrate Christmas I can maybe get extra pay
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Jhyan: Meanwhile I'm designing an app and hoping that will make me money
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Neo: Shii
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Neo: Anyways gtg
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/04/29, 20:33 - Jhyan: Ttyl
2019/04/29, 20:52 - Neo: What app was it
2019/04/29, 20:52 - Neo: Or will it be
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Jhyan: It's a service industry management AI
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Jhyan: So it tells waiters what to do and stuff
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Neo: What
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Jhyan: And manages the restaurant
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Jhyan: And they pay us a subscription
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Neo: Oh
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Jhyan: And it makes them more efficient
2019/04/29, 20:53 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 20:54 - Neo: How do you advertise that
2019/04/29, 20:54 - Jhyan: We haven't got there yet
2019/04/29, 20:54 - Jhyan: We've only just finished the UI
2019/04/29, 20:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/04/29, 20:55 - Jhyan: That's the splash screen
2019/04/29, 20:55 - Jhyan: I designed the logo, theme and name
2019/04/29, 20:56 - Neo: It looks sick
2019/04/29, 20:56 - Jhyan: Thanks
2019/04/29, 20:56 - Neo: What restaurants would need this
2019/04/29, 20:56 - Neo: Or what restaurants would sub
2019/04/29, 20:56 - Jhyan: All
2019/04/29, 20:57 - Jhyan: But we're gonna launch it in America because there's higher demand there
2019/04/29, 20:57 - Neo: Oh
2019/04/29, 20:57 - Jhyan: And also the fact that it **might** put lower management positions out of jobs won't be as impactful there
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Neo: Oh yeah
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Neo: Doesn't something like this exist
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Jhyan: It would only work here in high end restaurants
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Jhyan: Nah
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Jhyan: That's the amazing part of it
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Jhyan: It's so fucking easy to make
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Neo: Or what if it glitches
2019/04/29, 20:58 - Jhyan: Relatively speaking
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Jhyan: That's why we're gonna roll out an alpha and let restaurants use it for free while we work out the bugs
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Neo: And wouldn't a restaurant also have to buy additional hardware
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Jhyan: No they already have a computer
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Neo: Or better hardware
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Neo: Yeh?
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Jhyan: Which the main program gets stored on
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Jhyan: And the employees use an app
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Jhyan: And a headset
2019/04/29, 20:59 - Neo: On?
2019/04/29, 21:00 - Jhyan: We can get cheap ones for like R10 each from China
2019/04/29, 21:00 - Jhyan: Their phones
2019/04/29, 21:00 - Jhyan: This is America we're talking about remember
2019/04/29, 21:00 - Neo: That's assuming the employee has a good and usable phone
2019/04/29, 21:00 - Jhyan: Exhibit A
2019/04/29, 21:01 - Neo: Yeah but most people working as waiters are often lower class and that means they might have low quality phones
2019/04/29, 21:01 - Neo: Like my sister lol
2019/04/29, 21:01 - Jhyan: They still have smart phones
2019/04/29, 21:02 - Jhyan: What phone does your sister have
2019/04/29, 21:02 - Neo: My family said that she has to buy her own stuff since she can barely take care of any phone she gets
2019/04/29, 21:02 - Neo: Idk some low quality unknown brand
2019/04/29, 21:03 - Jhyan: Ok but it's still capable of running an app like this
2019/04/29, 21:03 - Neo: Or the Hisense you used to own
2019/04/29, 21:03 - Jhyan: The app is basically an interface, all the processing power needed comes from the restaurant main computer
2019/04/29, 21:03 - Neo: Yeah I guess
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Jhyan: And even then that's such a small amount since the actual AI and voice recognition is run by Microsoft/Google
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Neo: But some of those Chinese phones have a response time of like 3 seconds
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Jhyan: USA
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Neo: Yeh
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Neo: Yeh
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Neo: Oh well
2019/04/29, 21:04 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/29, 21:05 - Neo: I think this will work out really well
2019/04/29, 21:05 - Jhyan: I hope so
2019/04/29, 21:05 - Neo: Netoo
2019/04/29, 21:05 - Neo: Me too
2019/04/29, 21:06 - Neo: Than you can buy sekiro without having to worry about the price lol
2019/04/29, 21:06 - Jhyan: Haha
2019/04/29, 21:06 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/04/29, 21:07 - Jhyan: I can buy shares into stuff with Allan Gray
2019/04/29, 21:07 - Jhyan: And expand my empire
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Neo: Allan Gray?
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Jhyan: Just kidding haha I didn't say I was going to take over the world you did
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Neo: Yes I did
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Jhyan: It's an investment company that buys stuff from the stock market for you
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Neo: I take over world
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Jhyan: They predict it and they take a percentage
2019/04/29, 21:08 - Neo: Hmm
2019/04/29, 21:09 - Jhyan: Maybe if I make enough money with the app I'll be able to go to an Ivy League school without having to get a full scholarship
2019/04/29, 21:09 - Neo: O  . .  O
2019/04/29, 21:09 - Jhyan: That's just hoping though
2019/04/29, 21:09 - Neo: Why lol
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Jhyan: I mean I wouldn't really have to
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Neo: Yeah
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Jhyan: But it would be useful to start a tech business
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Jhyan: That's the plan
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Neo: Maybe a varsity or college
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Jhyan: Like Elon Musk
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Neo: Oh you were talking about those
2019/04/29, 21:10 - Neo: Than yah

2019/04/30, 15:23 - Neo: But auto correct already corrected the word
2019/04/30, 15:23 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/04/30, 15:23 - Neo: And was too lazy for the rest of the characters

2019/05/01, 18:22 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/05/01, 18:24 - Jhyan: But we still need to get there early because we need to wait in line for snacks and also we still need to use one of the terminals to print the tickets
2019/05/01, 18:24 - Neo: Yah defo
2019/05/01, 18:25 - Neo: We can even have lunch at a restaurant if we arrive earlier

2019/05/04, 15:58 - Jhyan: But remember the ques are really fucking long
2019/05/04, 15:58 - Neo: Ye
2019/05/04, 15:59 - Jhyan: You can come later if you want
2019/05/04, 15:59 - Jhyan: I'll just wait
2019/05/04, 15:59 - Jhyan: Like 4:30
2019/05/04, 16:11 - Jhyan: I have the ticket
2019/05/04, 16:11 - Jhyan: But we need to get snacks still
2019/05/04, 22:07 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2019/05/09, 16:37 - Neo: Hey I have both overcooked games
2019/05/09, 16:37 - Neo: Legally too
2019/05/09, 16:37 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/05/09, 16:38 - Jhyan: So you're suggesting we play those instead of the one I have
2019/05/09, 16:42 - Neo: Uh I don't think we have 4 PS4 controllers
2019/05/09, 16:42 - Jhyan: Ok
2019/05/09, 16:42 - Neo: And there isn't much of a difference
2019/05/09, 16:43 - Jhyan: So why did you tell me
2019/05/09, 16:43 - Jhyan: Just for the info
2019/05/09, 16:43 - Jhyan: Or were you suggesting something
2019/05/09, 16:51 - Neo: Yeh just thought you should know
2019/05/09, 16:51 - Jhyan: Ok cool
2019/05/09, 16:52 - Neo: Or maybe it would be better playing on the console since the controller problem wouldn't be as bad
2019/05/09, 16:52 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/05/09, 16:53 - Jhyan: I have a controller and don't you guys have 3
2019/05/09, 16:53 - Jhyan: So we can do that
2019/05/09, 17:59 - Neo: Ye

2019/06/10, 08:31 - Neo: I hope it doesn't flop
2019/06/11, 18:15 - Jhyan: Ok I know this is stereotypical
2019/06/11, 18:15 - Jhyan: But what's the difference between tagliatelle and fettuccine
2019/06/11, 18:15 - Jhyan: Because it looks like the same thing
2019/06/11, 18:16 - Jhyan: Does one of them have a bigger width
2019/06/11, 19:38 - Neo: I think they're the same but with different names
2019/06/11, 19:39 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/06/11, 19:39 - Jhyan: I asked Tamara
2019/06/11, 19:39 - Jhyan: She said they're the same thing
2019/06/11, 19:39 - Neo: Because that happens a lot with he other pastas too

2019/06/11, 21:17 - Jhyan: Which is cool
2019/06/11, 21:18 - Jhyan: It's nice coz no other VR headsets are that cheap yet, and now they're gonna have to adapt fast or they'll lose out on a huge amount of sales
2019/06/11, 21:19 - Jhyan: Nobody's gonna look at a headset that costs $999 or even $599 if you can get one about the same quality for $399
2019/06/11, 21:19 - Jhyan: Yes there's one that costs $999
2019/06/11, 21:29 - Neo: Jeepers

2019/06/13, 15:23 - Neo: When was it
2019/06/13, 15:25 - Jhyan: September or something
2019/06/13, 18:09 - Jhyan: Remember it was on the race track
2019/06/13, 18:09 - Jhyan: And I left a Voldemort wand there
2019/06/13, 18:10 - Jhyan: Let's go again this year
2019/06/13, 18:30 - Neo: Ye for sure
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Neo: Hace you seen the new black mirror

2019/06/13, 18:31 - Neo: Smithreen is good
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Jhyan: Smithereens is my favourite
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Jhyan: Episode 3 was just average
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Neo: Yea striking viprper is kinda whack
2019/06/13, 18:31 - Neo: Ima watch 3 rn

2019/06/19, 17:56 - Jhyan: I found out literally yesterday
2019/06/19, 17:56 - Jhyan: I'll watch the trailer now
2019/06/21, 18:57 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/06/21, 18:57 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2019/06/21, 18:58 - Jhyan: And yes, it is toast
2019/06/21, 19:02 - Neo: Forbidden cronch
2019/06/21, 19:02 - Neo: Or maybe just normal spicey cronch?
2019/06/21, 19:03 - Jhyan: Yeah lol
2019/06/21, 19:04 - Jhyan: When you just keep eating increasing spicier chili, until you don't even find the hottest one even mild
2019/06/21, 19:04 - Jhyan: So you resort to actual fire
2019/07/04, 10:34 - Neo: 'bout to wank out the entire new season of stranger things
2019/07/04, 10:34 - Neo: Whack
2019/07/04, 11:53 - Jhyan: Oh
2019/07/04, 11:53 - Jhyan: I got Trover Saves The Universe
2019/07/04, 11:56 - Neo: Wgich is
2019/07/04, 11:56 - Neo: I'll check
2019/07/04, 11:57 - Neo: Oh yeh is it any good
2019/07/04, 11:58 - Jhyan: Yeah it's really good
2019/07/04, 11:59 - Jhyan: The dialogue is some of the best I've ever seen
2019/07/04, 11:59 - Jhyan: Solely due to the fact that it is just really voluminous
2019/07/04, 12:00 - Jhyan: Everyone is always talking
2019/07/04, 12:00 - Jhyan: And depending on things you do they say even more things
2019/07/04, 12:00 - Jhyan: And you hardly ever get repeated voice lines
2019/07/04, 12:01 - Jhyan: Like he'll keep reminding you to press a button at one point, but it's a bunch of different variations on how to say "press the button"
2019/07/04, 12:42 - Neo: Oh?
2019/07/04, 12:43 - Neo: When I first saw it it looked very disappointing
2019/07/04, 12:43 - Neo: Or like it would become disappointing
2019/07/04, 13:07 - Jhyan: No
2019/07/04, 13:07 - Jhyan: It's good
2019/07/04, 13:08 - Jhyan: I'm getting an Oculus Rift soon for my birthday so I'll play it more when I can do so in VR
2019/07/04, 13:16 - Neo: Hmm
2019/07/04, 13:16 - Neo: I don't think it's worth it
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Jhyan: What
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Neo: Vr isn't that great
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Jhyan: It is
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Jhyan: You've always been a pessimist
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Jhyan: But I see where you're coming from
2019/07/04, 13:17 - Jhyan: We're a long way from true VR
2019/07/04, 13:18 - Jhyan: We still need better hardware, software, and importantly: solutions to immersion like an omnidirectional treadmill and haptic touch
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Jhyan: Anyway it's proven already that VR is becoming more and more prevalent, by the simple fact that the Oculus has been reinvented to be $200 cheaper than it was
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Neo: Yeah then why even by modern VR
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Jhyan: Which has economic consequences for the industry
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Neo: Buy
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Neo: It's not worth it
2019/07/04, 13:20 - Jhyan: VR is expanding to a more consumer friendly market, and with that comes innovation and investing
2019/07/04, 13:21 - Neo: And you'll be stuck with the older outdated model
2019/07/04, 13:22 - Jhyan: It is worth it.

Firstly I can guarantee you right now it will be something I enjoy for years.

Secondly I'm promoting this acceleration of the industry, and thereby creating a better VR world for my future
2019/07/04, 13:22 - Jhyan: It will get cheaper, meaning it will be even more accessible
2019/07/04, 13:23 - Jhyan: Just like how computers were these super expensive Ultra elite products
2019/07/04, 13:23 - Jhyan: Nobody is stuck with the outdated computers from the 80s
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Neo: Yah how long did that take
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Jhyan: It took decades because we didn't understand the technology of computers yet
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Jhyan: VR isn't an entirely new science
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Neo: Oh yeh
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Neo: that makes sense
2019/07/04, 13:24 - Jhyan: Although quantum computers are
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Jhyan: That's why VR is growing way faster than quantum computing is
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Neo: And VR isn't exactly new
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Jhyan: Yeah
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Jhyan: That too
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Neo: You're right
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Jhyan: It has origins in the 90s
2019/07/04, 13:25 - Jhyan: I agree though
2019/07/04, 13:26 - Neo: Yeh yeh
2019/07/04, 13:26 - Neo: But I still don't enjoy it
2019/07/04, 13:26 - Jhyan: I don't think people should buy VR unless they have a justification for doing so, such as knowing they will enjoy it, or that they want to contribute to the expansion of the industry
2019/07/04, 13:26 - Neo: Yah have you tried it
2019/07/04, 13:27 - Jhyan: Yes
2019/07/04, 13:27 - Neo: What did you try
2019/07/04, 13:27 - Neo: Or what did you play
2019/07/04, 13:27 - Jhyan: But further than that, I know it's many times better now than what it was
2019/07/04, 13:27 - Neo: Yeah ik
2019/07/04, 13:28 - Jhyan: I've used mobile headsets like the Samsung Gear VR, I've used the HTC Vive, and I've used an Oculus rift
2019/07/04, 13:28 - Jhyan: Although I'm not entirely sure about the last one
2019/07/04, 13:28 - Jhyan: If I did it was at rage like 3 years ago
2019/07/04, 13:28 - Neo: What did you play
2019/07/04, 13:28 - Neo: Or see? Idk
2019/07/04, 13:29 - Jhyan: TiltBrush
2019/07/04, 13:29 - Jhyan: This other cell VR thing
2019/07/04, 13:29 - Jhyan: And various mobile games, one of which I used a controller for and was able to interact with the world
2019/07/04, 13:30 - Jhyan: I gtg
2019/07/04, 13:30 - Jhyan: But I'll be back

2019/07/10, 20:08 - Jhyan: Gamer is more of hate speech
2019/07/10, 20:08 - Jhyan: Unless we RISE UP

2019/07/16, 19:20 - Jhyan: Ok dude I have a plan
2019/07/16, 19:21 - Jhyan: If we saved him, he would just flex on us and remind us that we can't afford airpods every 10 seconds in the shelter
2019/07/16, 19:21 - Jhyan: So if we leave him it's an epic gamer moment for everyone involved
2019/07/16, 20:32 - Neo: Yess

2019/10/23, 20:01 - Neo: Oh
2019/10/23, 20:01 - Neo: You pulled it out of your braces
2019/10/23, 20:02 - Jhyan: Yeah...

2019/11/19, 20:55 - Jhyan: That's a good thing
2019/11/19, 20:55 - Jhyan: Valve is steering us into VR
2019/11/19, 20:55 - Jhyan: Which means it will improve and develop as a field
2019/11/19, 20:55 - Neo: VR is gross
2019/11/19, 20:56 - Jhyan: You haven't even tried it
2019/11/19, 20:56 - Neo: Idk I dont think it will replace current type of gaming
2019/11/19, 20:56 - Neo: Yah I have tf
2019/11/19, 20:56 - Jhyan: Yeah like for 2 seconds at a convention 2 years ago
2019/11/19, 20:56 - Jhyan: I agree with this
2019/11/19, 20:57 - Jhyan: I don't think it will replace what we have
2019/11/19, 20:57 - Jhyan: But it isn't gimmicky anymore and it's growing
2019/11/19, 20:58 - Jhyan: It's waiting on the technology like haptic feedback and in-place movement solutions
2019/11/19, 20:59 - Neo: Idk where you drew this from
2019/11/19, 21:00 - Jhyan: What then
2019/11/19, 21:00 - Jhyan: Also I hate to be that guy but what you're saying is exactly what has been said throughout the ages whenever a new technology is emerging
2019/11/19, 21:01 - Neo: What that I dont like it
2019/11/19, 21:01 - Jhyan: When personal computers first became a thing people thought it was a young people "trend" that would die out
2019/11/19, 21:01 - Jhyan: In what way have you used VR
2019/11/19, 21:02 - Neo: Yeah that tends to happen when something new comes out with huge expectations and struggling to release a half decent game
2019/11/19, 21:02 - Neo: Bro when it was first introduced in 2014? Idk
2019/11/19, 21:02 - Jhyan: That's incomparable. Tech fields are totally different to sold products
2019/11/19, 21:04 - Jhyan: Exactly. That's what I'm saying. You used first gen headsets with low tracking capabilities, inferior resolution, unspecialised lenses, only 3dof instead of 6, and the list goes on
2019/11/19, 21:04 - Jhyan: Do you watch Rick and Morty
2019/11/19, 21:06 - Jhyan: I pirated the VR game. So next time you come over you can try it and see what I mean. Or Beat Saber. Or HHH, which is really fucking fun and describing why would be like describing why video games are fun to a grandparent.
2019/11/19, 21:07 - Neo: Ye
2019/11/19, 21:07 - Jhyan: Have you seen the new season btw

2019/11/19, 21:07 - Neo: Yeah
2019/11/19, 21:07 - Jhyan: I didn't like it as much as other episodes
2019/11/19, 21:07 - Jhyan: Episode 2
2019/11/19, 21:08 - Neo: Why tf weetabix taking so long
2019/11/19, 21:08 - Neo: Netflix
2019/11/19, 21:08 - Jhyan: They need to get licensing and nobody cares about South Africa so it's not a lucrative deal until about a year later
2019/11/19, 21:08 - Neo: Sheesh
2019/11/19, 21:09 - Jhyan: Blame copyright laws

2019/11/23, 11:05 - Jhyan: She has a cellphone
2019/11/23, 11:05 - Neo: CEO of YouTube, is that a polirician?
2019/11/23, 11:05 - Jhyan: She reported that the politicians she was speaking to didn't own then
2019/11/23, 11:05 - Neo: Yah
2019/11/23, 11:05 - Neo: Oooohh

2019/12/04, 20:04 - Neo: That thing where two pieces of ice stick to each other is called biting
2019/12/04, 20:04 - Neo: It's done intentionally in ice sculpting
2019/12/04, 21:21 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2019/12/04, 21:22 - Jhyan: To weld ice together
2019/12/04, 21:22 - Neo: It's easier to do by accident

2019/12/10, 22:59 - Jhyan: And I don't care about the romantic era of poetry dude
2019/12/10, 23:00 - Jhyan: I signed up thinking we were gonna learn about advanced grammar and philosophy as an actual topic and how English evolved as a language etymologically
2019/12/10, 23:01 - Jhyan: But I was only poetry and literature and time periods and more literature and no

2019/12/10, 23:11 - Jhyan: I wrote a whole essay on how I didn't read the books and how I philosophically chose to change my mind about the subject and drop it
2019/12/10, 23:11 - Jhyan: In the exam
2019/12/10, 23:11 - Jhyan: Kinda as a joke

2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: We have to do this trial at school
2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: For English
2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: It's based on a short story
2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: And we have to have a lawsuit
2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: But we get to pick our names
2020/02/26, 19:09 - Jhyan: The witnesses and lawyers
2020/02/26, 19:10 - Jhyan: So this one guy was gonna go as Ronald McDonald
2020/02/26, 19:10 - Jhyan: But the teacher overheard us planning it and said no
2020/02/26, 19:10 - Jhyan: I'm Lord Zuckerman
2020/02/26, 19:17 - Neo: Wow what a fucking loser
2020/02/26, 19:17 - Neo: Hiss
2020/02/28, 19:55 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 19:58 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/02/28, 19:58 - Jhyan: Capitalism strikes again
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Jhyan: What was that crappy fighting game where you start in a subway
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Jhyan: That you liked so much
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Neo: LID
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Neo: Let It Die
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Neo: Not crappy!
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Neo: Very unappreciated
2020/02/28, 19:59 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/02/28, 20:00 - Neo: You eat mushrooms and go invisible
2020/02/28, 20:00 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Neo: That a tomatoes
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Jhyan: Italy
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Jhyan: He's doing the stereotypical Italian hand style
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Jhyan: Also he's a tomato
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Neo: Aahhh yes italy, known for mushrooms
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Neo: Oh yeah that's a fortnite skin
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/02/28, 20:01 - Jhyan: I deep fried it
2020/02/28, 20:02 - Neo: That's been in the game for 2 years lol
2020/02/28, 20:02 - Jhyan: I was searching "angry tomato"
2020/02/28, 20:02 - Neo: Oh hehe
2020/02/28, 20:02 - Neo: Just make it yourself
2020/02/28, 20:02 - Neo: Like annoying orange
2020/02/28, 20:03 - Jhyan: Tamara drew a face on the board and I said it looks like an angry tomato
2020/02/28, 20:03 - Jhyan: But she didn't believe me
2020/02/28, 20:03 - Jhyan: So I wanted to prove it to her
2020/02/28, 20:04 - Neo: Oh ye?
2020/02/28, 20:04 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 20:04 - Neo: Why would it be capitalism
2020/02/28, 20:04 - Neo: Hehe yess
2020/02/28, 20:04 - Jhyan: Because they're forcing you to buy an adaptor
2020/02/28, 20:05 - Jhyan: But it could've been easily supported with just USB
2020/02/28, 20:05 - Neo: Oh no uhm
2020/02/28, 20:05 - Jhyan: And that's if they even needed to add support, rather than blocking support
2020/02/28, 20:05 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 20:06 - Neo: It works on fortnite and minecraft
2020/02/28, 20:06 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/02/28, 20:06 - Jhyan: Does it work on singleplayer games
2020/02/28, 20:06 - Neo: But the rest of games I own like Battlefield 5, R6S, DS3 even and probably sekiro
2020/02/28, 20:07 - Neo: Haven't tried any single player games
2020/02/28, 20:07 - Jhyan: Dude I restarted Dark Souls III after my save got wiped
2020/02/28, 20:07 - Jhyan: I'm way better at it
2020/02/28, 20:07 - Jhyan: Like I'm already kinda far in the game
2020/02/28, 20:08 - Neo: Really?,
2020/02/28, 20:08 - Neo: Yoo that's so sick
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: I already killed the first main boss
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: And I'm at the second one
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: And I have access to way more areas now
2020/02/28, 20:09 - Jhyan: Did you finish Sekiro
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Neo: Almos
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Neo: Last boss
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Neo: But I got side tracked with school work and other games
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Jhyan: I did this in 8 hours btw
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Jhyan: Last time it took me 94
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Neo: Yoouch
2020/02/28, 20:10 - Jhyan: But that's including learning the game and stuff
2020/02/28, 20:11 - Jhyan: Gimme a budget
2020/02/28, 20:12 - Jhyan: Coz I could make you a PC that's 6k or I could make one that's 50k
2020/02/28, 20:12 - Jhyan: It's highly variable
2020/02/28, 20:12 - Jhyan: And based on what you value
2020/02/28, 20:15 - Neo: Uh 12k
2020/02/28, 20:15 - Neo: Oh uh fps and graphics
2020/02/28, 20:15 - Jhyan: Do you want a lot of storage
2020/02/28, 20:15 - Jhyan: Is 1tb enough
2020/02/28, 20:16 - Neo: Uh yeah
2020/02/28, 20:16 - Jhyan: Ok so
2020/02/28, 20:16 - Jhyan: Do you want a lot of RAM
2020/02/28, 20:17 - Neo: What does RAM do lol
2020/02/28, 20:17 - Jhyan: That won't affect your FPS, probably loading time and render distance and amount of simultaneous open stuff
2020/02/28, 20:18 - Jhyan: Lemme look at some game requirements
2020/02/28, 20:23 - Neo: Uh no I dont think that has to be expensive
2020/02/28, 20:24 - Jhyan: Gimme some games you'd want to pay
2020/02/28, 20:24 - Jhyan: *play
2020/02/28, 20:25 - Neo: Probs just ds3, mc and r6s
2020/02/28, 20:30 - Neo: I'll have to check
2020/02/28, 20:32 - Jhyan: Do you only need the computer
2020/02/28, 20:32 - Jhyan: Or do you need a monitor and keyboard and mouse and headphones and stuff
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Jhyan: Do you need a monitor
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Neo: Uh pc, monitor and mnk
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Jhyan: So everything
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Neo: Uh but ik what monitor I want
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Neo: Ye
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Jhyan: Is it included in your budget
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Neo: And mouse and keyboard
2020/02/28, 20:36 - Jhyan: Does your budget include these items
2020/02/28, 20:37 - Neo: No
2020/02/28, 20:41 - Jhyan: Ok so the 12k is purely for the PC
2020/02/28, 20:48 - Jhyan: What kind of case do you want
2020/02/28, 20:48 - Neo: Uh does that matter
2020/02/28, 20:48 - Neo: Any
2020/02/28, 20:48 - Neo: Does it actually matter
2020/02/28, 20:48 - Jhyan: Well you want it to look cool
2020/02/28, 20:49 - Jhyan: And only you have your idea of what cool looks like
2020/02/28, 20:49 - Neo: Oh no it could be turd shaped it's fine
2020/02/28, 20:49 - Jhyan: **cracks knuckles** 

"Turd shaped computer case"
2020/02/28, 20:49 - Jhyan: >enter
2020/02/28, 20:51 - Neo: Lmaoo
2020/02/28, 20:51 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/02/28, 20:52 - Neo: Carrot pants=can't
2020/03/02, 17:06 - Neo: Woah I cam up with an idea
2020/03/02, 17:06 - Neo: What if you could make like a chip or maybe bigger and then make it show up in a sort of camera app on your phone
2020/03/02, 17:06 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Neo: So you could put it on your car keys or something
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Neo: Hhm
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Jhyan: They already have that
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Neo: Like an augmented reality looking thing
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Neo: Ye?
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Neo: What's it called
2020/03/02, 17:07 - Jhyan: Wait what
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Neo: Ooohh lmao I got the idea from rainbow six
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Jhyan: What's the point of it
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Neo: To find something you loose often
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Neo: Like IQ's electronic detector
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Neo: From r6
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Jhyan: That's not how it works
2020/03/02, 17:08 - Neo: Lose
2020/03/02, 17:09 - Neo: What
2020/03/02, 17:09 - Jhyan: The chip needs to be in the camera and have a recognisable pattern on it for AR
2020/03/02, 17:09 - Jhyan: Like in the view of the camera
2020/03/02, 17:09 - Jhyan: Or else just be a GPS location
2020/03/02, 17:10 - Neo: Oh that sucks
2020/03/02, 17:10 - Jhyan: You could probably build a special camera that does what you want with a signal or something
2020/03/02, 17:10 - Neo: You don't think it's possible to make
2020/03/02, 17:10 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/02, 17:10 - Jhyan: It is but I don't think anyone will care enough
2020/03/02, 17:11 - Neo: Yeah if you have to buy a whole new camera then definitely
2020/03/06, 19:29 - Neo: Have you ever watched castlevania
2020/03/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: I was watching session 3 earlier
2020/03/06, 21:07 - Neo: Ye I'm halfway through
2020/03/06, 21:07 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/06, 21:24 - Jhyan: *season
2020/03/06, 21:24 - Jhyan: It's really good
2020/03/06, 21:24 - Jhyan: My favourite character is Isaac
2020/03/06, 21:25 - Neo: Yeah same
2020/03/16, 13:44 - Neo: Do you have prey
2020/03/16, 13:45 - Jhyan: I used to at least
2020/03/16, 13:45 - Jhyan: It was a great game
2020/03/16, 13:45 - Neo: Did you buy it or pirate it
2020/03/16, 15:43 - Jhyan: Pirate
2020/03/17, 12:09 - Jhyan: Why
2020/03/17, 12:10 - Neo: Idk I kind of want to play it
2020/03/17, 12:10 - Jhyan: It's really good
2020/03/17, 12:10 - Neo: Ye? I saw gameplay and looks v interesting
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: It's really good
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: Like you're on a station
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: And there's really well designed aliens
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Neo: Ye I'll try it 1 day
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: And it's got perfectly balanced action and stealth
2020/03/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: And your movement is always smooth
2020/03/17, 12:13 - Jhyan: And the weapons are so original and fun to use
2020/03/17, 12:13 - Neo: You know console limited the games capabilities
2020/03/17, 12:13 - Neo: Or they would have fone more with the game but if they did it would compromise the quality
2020/03/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: They should really stop doing that
2020/03/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: They should just make it worse for console versions
2020/03/17, 12:14 - Neo: Well if they want sales
2020/03/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: It would push the console companies to actually make better consoles
2020/03/17, 12:15 - Neo: Oh I ghess
2020/03/17, 12:15 - Jhyan: They'll still get sales dude
2020/03/17, 12:15 - Neo: Yeah no I thought you meant they should bother making a console version
2020/03/17, 12:15 - Neo: Shouldnt*
2020/03/17, 12:18 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/17, 12:19 - Jhyan: It's not even that much effort
2020/03/17, 12:19 - Jhyan: Just cap the quality of the game on consoles
2020/03/17, 13:13 - Jhyan: https://youtu.be/sxnJcZvuRK8
2020/03/17, 13:14 - Neo: Definitely will get boycotted
2020/03/17, 13:14 - Jhyan: Only if one company does it
2020/03/17, 13:14 - Jhyan: Plus they can charge PC higher
2020/03/17, 13:15 - Jhyan: The thing is that they're not the ones at fault
2020/03/17, 13:15 - Jhyan: It's the console companies
2020/03/17, 13:15 - Neo: Yeah but that wont stop ignorant fanboys
2020/03/17, 13:15 - Neo: I saw this lol
2020/03/17, 13:16 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/03/17, 13:16 - Jhyan: It will if all of the companies start doing it
2020/03/17, 13:16 - Jhyan: They'll have no more games to play
2020/03/17, 13:16 - Neo: Hmm
2020/03/17, 13:16 - Neo: Yeah maybe
2020/03/19, 16:01 - Neo: Have you seen Scissor Seven
2020/03/19, 16:01 - Neo: Its a Chinese cartoon with a nice art style
2020/03/19, 16:51 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/03/19, 16:51 - Jhyan: I'll look it up
2020/03/19, 16:52 - Jhyan: It looks cool
2020/03/19, 16:53 - Jhyan: I added it to my Netflix list
2020/03/19, 17:02 - Neo: The story and voice acting is fine
2020/03/19, 17:03 - Neo: The animation is really nice though
2020/03/24, 10:27 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/24, 10:42 - Neo: No ita nothing lol
2020/03/24, 10:43 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/24, 10:45 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/24, 10:46 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/24, 12:55 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/26, 08:42 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/26, 08:42 - Neo: Lmao
2020/03/26, 18:17 - Jhyan: The story is good so far
2020/03/26, 18:18 - Jhyan: Of scissor seven
2020/03/26, 18:18 - Neo: How far are you
2020/03/26, 18:18 - Jhyan: End of the first episode
2020/03/26, 18:19 - Neo: Oh
2020/03/26, 18:19 - Neo: Yeah its fine
2020/03/26, 19:49 - Neo: What do you think of solar opposites
2020/03/26, 19:50 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/26, 19:51 - Neo: Just check the trailer on yt, justin roland new project
2020/03/26, 19:54 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/03/26, 19:55 - Jhyan: I don't like it
2020/03/26, 19:58 - Neo: Ye? It looks nice
2020/03/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: Nah
2020/03/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: It looks cringe
2020/03/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: Like a sitcom
2020/03/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: Rick and Morty has meaning in it
2020/03/26, 20:38 - Jhyan: And it's also it's own thing
2020/03/26, 20:39 - Neo: It looks like rick and morty
2020/03/26, 20:39 - Jhyan: We have too many of these "funny" adult cartoons
2020/03/26, 20:39 - Jhyan: Yeah the art style is fine, I'm talking about the premise
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Neo: Yeah rick and morty started off the same wouldnt you say
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Neo: There is no way it didnt
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Jhyan: It started off as a parody of back to the future and doctor Who
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Jhyan: And the show has never been a sitcom
2020/03/26, 20:40 - Neo: And that's meaning?
2020/03/26, 20:41 - Jhyan: It didn't start off as something that smells of a cheap way to make some cash
2020/03/26, 20:41 - Jhyan: That didn't look funny
2020/03/26, 20:42 - Neo: Yeah it was unique, well as unique as a parody could get
2020/03/26, 20:42 - Jhyan: Yeah it was only loosely a parody
2020/03/26, 20:42 - Jhyan: The point is that it was new and it was its own thing
2020/03/26, 20:43 - Jhyan: Solar opposites just looks like a clone of other shows but reskinned with Justin Roiland's art style
2020/03/26, 20:48 - Neo: Yeah now that you say that it does look a little like the Simpsons, family guy etc
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Neo: But isn't that the whole point
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: Yeah it is
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: But I hate those type of shows
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: They're not funny to me
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: It's like friends
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: It's so cringe to watch it
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Neo: Really
2020/03/26, 20:49 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Neo: No those dont cringe me but the office and the big bang are unbearable
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Jhyan: Nah the office is gold
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Jhyan: Big bang theory is unbearable though
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Neo: Watching them is painful
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Neo: I tried
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Jhyan: No but it's so bad that it's good
2020/03/26, 20:50 - Jhyan: That's why
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Jhyan: Sometimes it's also just so good that it's good
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Neo: I really couldn't continue
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Jhyan: It does both
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Neo: I like when mike was making an indian accent in front of the indian lady
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Neo: That scene was hilarious
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/03/26, 20:51 - Jhyan: The funniest thing for me was later
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Neo: But there are times when it's literally nothing
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Jhyan: There was this character called Holly
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Jhyan: She was only temporary
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Jhyan: But she and Michael both liked each other
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Jhyan: But that's not the point
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Neo: Oh like a side character
2020/03/26, 20:52 - Jhyan: Basically when she was getting introduced to everyone, Dwight told her that Kevin was autistic
2020/03/26, 20:53 - Jhyan: So she was like really really nice to Kevin for a few episodes
2020/03/26, 20:53 - Neo: Who is kevin
2020/03/26, 20:53 - Jhyan: And then finally someone was angry at Kevin
2020/03/26, 20:53 - Jhyan: https://images.app.goo.gl/XsNS42oHZCEL1JRb7
2020/03/26, 20:54 - Jhyan: So they called him an idiot
2020/03/26, 20:54 - Neo: Oh ya
2020/03/26, 20:54 - Jhyan: And then Holly got really angry and said that he wasn't an idiot, he was just special
2020/03/26, 20:54 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/03/26, 20:54 - Neo: Have you seen Better Call Saul
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: And then everyone went silent
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Neo: Yeah that's pretty funny
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: It was great because it built up over multiple episodes
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: And then the episode ended
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: I couldn't stop laughing for like 10 minutes
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: And I'm not even exaggerating
2020/03/26, 20:55 - Jhyan: I want to
2020/03/26, 20:56 - Neo: It isnt as action packed as breaking bad
2020/03/26, 20:56 - Jhyan: I know
2020/03/26, 20:56 - Neo: But I like the first episode and last episode of season 1
2020/03/26, 22:45 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/27, 10:01 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/28, 12:38 - Jhyan: 7 seeds part 2 is out now
2020/03/28, 12:38 - Jhyan: Idk why you didn't like it that much, the show is really good
2020/03/28, 12:41 - Neo: Ok what's good about it
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Jhyan: The characters
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Jhyan: The story idea itself isn't that good
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Jhyan: But the continuous story told through the idea is
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Jhyan: In other words, I don't care about the idea that there's a bunch of people selected to go to the future
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Neo: The characters?
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Neo: The generic anime characters
2020/03/28, 12:42 - Jhyan: It's great because the characters are so good
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Jhyan: No they're not
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Jhyan: Some of them are
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Neo: The ones that value friendship and never giving up
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Neo: With their generic names
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Jhyan: Yes I agree
2020/03/28, 12:43 - Jhyan: But you have to have those
2020/03/28, 12:44 - Jhyan: They're not the main characters in my opinion
2020/03/28, 12:44 - Jhyan: A few of them are exceptionally crafted
2020/03/28, 12:44 - Jhyan: Even all of team summer A is good because they share the same backstory
2020/03/28, 12:45 - Neo: I already forgot all of it
2020/03/28, 12:45 - Jhyan: And even then, the character interactions between everyone are good
2020/03/28, 12:45 - Neo: Which characters
2020/03/28, 12:45 - Neo: Yeah but that's not difficult with tv shows
2020/03/28, 12:47 - Jhyan: Ango, Aramaki, Aota, Mouzu, Hana, The ventriloquist guy, Hana's father from the past,
2020/03/28, 12:48 - Jhyan: Those are the ones with the most content in them
2020/03/28, 12:48 - Neo: Yeah I dont know or remember any of them
2020/03/28, 12:48 - Jhyan: Then why did you ask
2020/03/28, 12:48 - Neo: Yeah that's another point there are too many characters
2020/03/28, 12:49 - Neo: To see if it would trigger some memory
2020/03/28, 12:49 - Jhyan: If that were true, I wouldn't have seen it as a particularly significant good quality in this show
2020/03/28, 12:49 - Neo: Maybe you haven't seen as much tv as me idk
2020/03/28, 12:50 - Jhyan: If that's your argument, then it still doesn't work
2020/03/28, 12:50 - Jhyan: Because it means you're comparing it to the good shows you've watched
2020/03/28, 12:51 - Jhyan: And not want of the lesser ones
2020/03/28, 12:51 - Jhyan: So by merit of that, it's still a good show
2020/03/28, 12:52 - Neo: I still dont like it
2020/03/28, 12:52 - Neo: And I'm not comparing it to any of the good shows I've seen
2020/03/28, 12:53 - Jhyan: You are, whether you know it or not
2020/03/28, 12:54 - Jhyan: If you've watched a lot of shows you really like, those form a mental picture of what you consider good
2020/03/28, 12:54 - Jhyan: Give me an example of something you've watched with really good characters
2020/03/28, 12:55 - Jhyan: And explain why you think they're good
2020/03/28, 12:57 - Neo: Wait how does comparing something bad to something good make it good
2020/03/28, 12:57 - Neo: Just because you're not comparing something bad to something worse doesnt make it good
2020/03/28, 12:57 - Jhyan: It doesn't
2020/03/28, 12:58 - Jhyan: If you're comparing something good to your standard of perfect, it will never be good
2020/03/28, 12:58 - Neo: Sorry I'm fighting dancer of boreal
2020/03/28, 12:58 - Jhyan: ? How do you have Dark Souls III
2020/03/28, 12:58 - Neo: So if I keep going offline that's why
2020/03/28, 12:58 - Neo: I have always had it
2020/03/28, 12:59 - Neo: Never owned another ds
2020/03/28, 12:59 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/03/28, 12:59 - Neo: I'm not comparing it to something perfect
2020/03/28, 12:59 - Neo: Over the garden wall
2020/03/28, 12:59 - Neo: But OTGW best quality Iis the music
2020/03/28, 13:00 - Jhyan: Only Wirt was good
2020/03/28, 13:00 - Neo: What
2020/03/28, 13:01 - Neo: Okay yes
2020/03/28, 13:01 - Neo: Beatrice went through a bit of development
2020/03/28, 13:01 - Jhyan: Ok let me explain why Ango is good
2020/03/28, 13:01 - Neo: What makes Wirt good
2020/03/28, 13:02 - Neo: Ok finish this first
2020/03/28, 13:02 - Jhyan: He was one of the genetically selected (grown?) children that was trained to be part of the 7 seeds programme.
2020/03/28, 13:02 - Jhyan: I'm gonna explain over multiple messages
2020/03/28, 13:03 - Jhyan: So him and a lot of other kids were constantly pushed to their maximum potential with every subject of science and practical applications possible
2020/03/28, 13:04 - Jhyan: He became friends with this smaller, less capable kid, Shigeru. He was always encouraging and helping Shigeru.
2020/03/28, 13:04 - Neo: I like the mystery and some story aspects of the show
2020/03/28, 13:05 - Jhyan: At one point a few of them made friendship bracelets out of coloured string, each a different colour.
2020/03/28, 13:06 - Jhyan: Later, one of the instructors was being particularly harsh on one of the friends, and Ango stepped in the way. This led him to get solitary confinement in the "red room"
2020/03/28, 13:07 - Neo: And the backstory of some of the characters
2020/03/28, 13:07 - Neo: Monster design is really nice too
2020/03/28, 13:07 - Jhyan: The red room was the place where all the cattle and other ways was ground up into a red paste
2020/03/28, 13:07 - Jhyan: To be used for fertilizer
2020/03/28, 13:08 - Jhyan: But he found an arm in there, with the red friendship bracelet, belonging to a girl from the friendship group that failed at something
2020/03/28, 13:08 - Jhyan: The instructors told the children that those who were failing were being sent to the outside, or home
2020/03/28, 13:09 - Neo: Okay this good
2020/03/28, 13:09 - Jhyan: He kept this information to himself and started working way harder to be among the 7 chosen. He got stricter with Shigeru to improve
2020/03/28, 13:09 - Jhyan: Shigeru started distancing himself from Ango because of his change
2020/03/28, 13:10 - Jhyan: Eventually, when they all turned 17, the final test started. This consisted of the instructors giving them faulty equipment, poisoning their food supply, and eventually blowing up their dormitories
2020/03/28, 13:10 - Jhyan: So they were forced to survive in the mountains until only 7 remained
2020/03/28, 13:11 - Jhyan: Ango had taken supplies for both him and Shigeru, and this made another guy really angry at Ango, because he thought Ango stole everything for himself
2020/03/28, 13:12 - Jhyan: So this guy went to Shigeru and made him signal Ango with Morse code that he was in trouble and needed Ango
2020/03/28, 13:12 - Neo: Does human meat even make good fertiliser
2020/03/28, 13:12 - Jhyan: Ango came running, because he was worried about Shigeru, and was pushed into a really deep hole by the angry guy
2020/03/28, 13:14 - Jhyan: Shigeru and another guy, Ryo, teamed up against the angry guy and eventually they killed him and managed to help Ango out of the pit.
2020/03/28, 13:14 - Neo: What episode is this
2020/03/28, 13:14 - Jhyan: But as all three of them were climbing back out, Ango made a mistake due to his injuries and both him and Shigeru were hanging off of an anchor in the stone.
2020/03/28, 13:15 - Jhyan: Prior to this, the instructors had told both Ango, Ryo and Shigeru that only two of them could be among the 7
2020/03/28, 13:15 - Jhyan: So Ryo, remembering this, cut Shigeru off
2020/03/28, 13:16 - Jhyan: The reason they were climbing out like this in the first place was because the rope they had tied from the outside was cut by the instructors, to force this decision
2020/03/28, 13:16 - Jhyan: Ango was mentally broken after that
2020/03/28, 13:16 - Jhyan: All of the remaining 7 were
2020/03/28, 13:17 - Jhyan: None of them even wanted to go to the future, they had all lost their friends and sanity in this brutal last test
2020/03/28, 13:17 - Jhyan: But they were forced to go
2020/03/28, 13:17 - Jhyan: As they woke up, in the future, the instructor that was brought with as a result of their mental state being compromised, walked into the room
2020/03/28, 13:18 - Jhyan: They all pulled out their guns and killed him simultaneously
2020/03/28, 13:18 - Jhyan: 10
2020/03/28, 13:18 - Neo: Oh I think I saw it
2020/03/28, 13:18 - Jhyan: Ango was hearing voices and was mentally unstable after this. He was violent and had impaired moral judgement
2020/03/28, 13:19 - Jhyan: The director of the summer A project was Hana's dad
2020/03/28, 13:20 - Neo: Hana was the 1 with big boobies looking for her boyfriend right
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Jhyan: Nvm
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Jhyan: But she wasn't overly sexualised like that
2020/03/28, 13:21 - Neo: Yeah but it isnt impossible to notice
2020/03/28, 13:22 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/28, 13:22 - Jhyan: Her boobs weren't big
2020/03/28, 13:22 - Neo: Her breats
2020/03/28, 13:22 - Neo: Breasts
2020/03/28, 13:22 - Neo: Compared to other characters
2020/03/28, 13:23 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/03/28, 13:23 - Jhyan: They did look bigger with the jacket she originally had in
2020/03/28, 13:23 - Jhyan: *on
2020/03/28, 13:24 - Neo: Yeah it's her only memorable character trait
2020/03/28, 13:24 - Jhyan: But there was even a scene where Ango walked in on her while she was in the shower (a nod to the fact that he wasn't taught those kinds of social standards), and they weren't big
2020/03/28, 13:24 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/28, 13:25 - Neo: Only reason I remember her
2020/03/28, 13:25 - Jhyan: Her father was the director of the summer A project, and it lead to her realising that she didn't know him and sparked conflict between her and Ango
2020/03/28, 13:26 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/28, 13:26 - Jhyan: In part 2, she is also pivotal to when they exile Ango
2020/03/28, 13:28 - Neo: The character design is basic, dialogue is unnatural
2020/03/28, 13:28 - Neo: And animation is below average
2020/03/28, 13:29 - Jhyan: I agree with that
2020/03/28, 13:29 - Jhyan: Besides the dialogue
2020/03/28, 13:29 - Neo: No ways that's the worst part
2020/03/28, 13:30 - Neo: Do you watch it in dub
2020/03/28, 13:30 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/03/28, 13:31 - Neo: Then how can you disagree
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Jhyan: Did you also watch it in dub
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Neo: Yes
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Jhyan: It didn't seem unnatural
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Neo: Okay pick any 30 second clip of the show
2020/03/28, 13:32 - Neo: Give me a time stamp and episode
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Jhyan: I can't just do that
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Neo: I'll tell you how its odd
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Neo: Should pick any 30 seconds of dialogue
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Neo: Because if I do it will be very biased
2020/03/28, 13:33 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/03/28, 13:34 - Jhyan: Go to the start of episode 13
2020/03/28, 13:34 - Jhyan: From part 2
2020/03/28, 13:34 - Neo: No time stamp
2020/03/28, 13:34 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/28, 13:34 - Jhyan: But skip the intro
2020/03/28, 13:35 - Jhyan: So take it from the part before the intro and don't count the intro as time
2020/03/28, 13:37 - Neo: When the little child starts talking to Ango
2020/03/28, 13:37 - Neo: Wtf is that
2020/03/28, 13:37 - Jhyan: What
2020/03/28, 13:37 - Jhyan: When
2020/03/28, 13:38 - Neo: At 20:40
2020/03/28, 13:38 - Neo: Around 20:40
2020/03/28, 13:38 - Neo: There is a lot of unnecessary dialogue
2020/03/28, 13:38 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/03/28, 13:39 - Neo: Which is there to make it seem more natural, which actually makes it worse
2020/03/28, 13:39 - Jhyan: It's not
2020/03/28, 13:39 - Jhyan: It's necessary
2020/03/28, 13:39 - Neo: Maybe I lack context but what's the point of telling the child that the people are dangerous
2020/03/28, 13:39 - Neo: Was he/she not there the whole time
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Jhyan: That's not at 20:40
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Jhyan: ?
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Neo: Why does the kid repeat themselves
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Neo: I'm watching on mobile
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Jhyan: She's talking about how he watched Hana die
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Neo: When there are 20:40 minutes left
2020/03/28, 13:40 - Jhyan: Yeah... That's this
2020/03/28, 13:41 - Jhyan: She doesn't
2020/03/28, 13:42 - Jhyan: What people? When do they tell her that
2020/03/28, 13:42 - Neo: When the child grabs his hand with the knife
2020/03/28, 13:42 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/28, 13:43 - Jhyan: She immediately starts talking about how he watched Hana die
2020/03/28, 13:43 - Neo: Okay the dialogue is waaaay better
2020/03/28, 13:43 - Neo: No
2020/03/28, 13:43 - Neo: I'll admit it, there are so many bad scenes
2020/03/28, 13:43 - Jhyan: Oh that
2020/03/28, 13:44 - Jhyan: But that supports the fact that he was trying to keep the blond pianist guy away from her in part 1, and that he's now active frantic
2020/03/28, 13:44 - Neo: At 17:51, the one character asks why the other character is crying
2020/03/28, 13:44 - Jhyan: Trying to turn people back against them
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Neo: Whilst witnessing this interaction
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Neo: ????
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Jhyan: That is kinda weird, but it fits her character
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Jhyan: She expects him not to cry
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Neo: Which is the hardened character with no morals
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Jhyan: Idk dude
2020/03/28, 13:45 - Neo: Oh I thought she was one the tough characters
2020/03/28, 13:46 - Jhyan: It's not unnatural to me
2020/03/28, 13:46 - Jhyan: And it's only one example that I can't directly explain
2020/03/28, 13:46 - Neo: Should I try find one
2020/03/28, 13:46 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/03/28, 13:46 - Jhyan: Look in part 1
2020/03/28, 13:47 - Neo: Yeah okay
2020/03/28, 13:48 - Jhyan: Also read SCP 1730
2020/03/28, 13:48 - Jhyan: It's really good
2020/03/28, 13:48 - Jhyan: It's long, but most of it is just mission transcripts, which are more like a story
2020/03/28, 13:48 - Jhyan: Instead of a clinical description
2020/03/28, 13:49 - Neo: Uh okay let me look for the clip that just destroyed the show for me
2020/03/28, 13:49 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/28, 13:54 - Neo: At 11 minutes left at the episode
2020/03/28, 13:54 - Neo: They realise that they can idk cure the infection with salt
2020/03/28, 13:55 - Neo: The way he brings it up and tells the other character is so uncomfortable to me
2020/03/28, 13:56 - Jhyan: Which episode
2020/03/28, 13:56 - Neo: Grain Rain ep6
2020/03/28, 13:57 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/03/28, 13:58 - Neo: Ep10 18:50
2020/03/28, 13:58 - Neo: When he asks if either if them are hurt
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Jhyan: Idk why you find it unnatural
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Neo: No one talks like that
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Jhyan: People in film do all the time
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Jhyan: Literally all the time
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Neo: No
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Jhyan: You're expecting them to talk like in real life
2020/03/28, 13:59 - Jhyan: It's film standard
2020/03/28, 14:00 - Jhyan: Like how on a stage you can't have your back to the audience
2020/03/28, 14:00 - Jhyan: Nobody stands like that
2020/03/28, 14:00 - Neo: Its nothing like that
2020/03/28, 14:00 - Jhyan: It is
2020/03/28, 14:00 - Jhyan: To come up with a quick conclusion like that you have to have that weird jump in logic
2020/03/28, 14:01 - Jhyan: I've seen similar dialogue countless times
2020/03/28, 14:01 - Neo: In the show
2020/03/28, 14:01 - Neo: Yeah I know
2020/03/28, 14:02 - Neo: "I don't feel so good"
"Are either of you hurt?"
2020/03/28, 14:03 - Neo: Ep10 18:22
2020/03/28, 14:03 - Jhyan: Ok I'll give you that one
2020/03/28, 14:04 - Jhyan: 18:22 is fine
2020/03/28, 14:04 - Neo: "I know you're not taking all of that with you"
"Yeah, that's right"
* weirdest fucking pause on the planet *
"Hey now that's not fair"
2020/03/28, 14:05 - Neo: And before the guy can finish saying "hey now that's not fair" he immediately says "let's split it up"
2020/03/28, 14:05 - Jhyan: Nah nothing about that is weird
2020/03/28, 14:06 - Neo: So it's like "Hey now that's not fairlets split it up"
2020/03/28, 14:06 - Jhyan: No it's the same guy saying both of that
2020/03/28, 14:06 - Jhyan: Nah it's not
2020/03/28, 14:06 - Jhyan: It sounds normal
2020/03/28, 14:06 - Neo: No ways 18:22 is worse than 18:50
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Neo: That's what makes it sound so weird
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Jhyan: Hey man, that's not fair let's split it up amongst ourselves
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Jhyan: Maybe to be an English teacher he would've added a comma before fair and let's
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Neo: Okay but what about that pause
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Jhyan: But people don't do that generally
2020/03/28, 14:07 - Jhyan: The pause is not "weirdest on the fucking planet"
2020/03/28, 14:08 - Jhyan: It's kinda weird, but it's within reason
2020/03/28, 14:08 - Neo: It's like he cant talk and walk at the same time
2020/03/28, 14:08 - Jhyan: It could've been the guy surprised that Ango was in fact taking all of the stuff
2020/03/28, 14:09 - Jhyan: He says it as he steps towards Ango
2020/03/28, 14:09 - Neo: No he dossnt
2020/03/28, 14:09 - Jhyan: So it's like he takes a moment to process the fact that Ango is taking everything, and then he's trying to bargain as he steps in
2020/03/28, 14:09 - Jhyan: Yes he did
2020/03/28, 14:09 - Neo: What's the characters name yokai
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Jhyan: He says "hey now..."on his second step
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Jhyan: Literally
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Jhyan: And then he takes another step
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Neo: Yeah and that isnt weird to you
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Jhyan: During the rest of his sentence
2020/03/28, 14:10 - Jhyan: No it isn't
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Neo: I think we need a other opinion on this
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Jhyan: Yes beginning more confrontational by moving closer to Ango at the same time as trying to bargain
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Jhyan: You're gonna bring in someone that thinks like you
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Neo: No
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Jhyan: And you're gonna ask them if they think it's weird
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Neo: That's why I'm asking you
2020/03/28, 14:11 - Jhyan: It's impossible to test a third party
2020/03/28, 14:12 - Jhyan: Because the only way to do so unbiased would be to show them the clip by itself
2020/03/28, 14:12 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/28, 14:12 - Jhyan: And IF they say something about it being weird, it's weird
2020/03/28, 14:12 - Jhyan: You can't ask them if it is or not
2020/03/28, 14:13 - Neo: But then that's just playing into their ignorance
2020/03/28, 14:13 - Jhyan: Dude if you showed someone a normal photo and asked someone if they thought it was weird, they'd say yes
2020/03/28, 14:13 - Jhyan: And point out things in it that aren't weird, but they'd justify that they are some other way
2020/03/28, 14:14 - Neo: Because they might not be paying attention to what they are meant to
2020/03/28, 14:14 - Jhyan: The same would happen if you asked if they thought it was normal
2020/03/28, 14:14 - Jhyan: The question influences them
2020/03/28, 14:15 - Neo: Maybe if we show them the clip and ask them to pay attention to everything
2020/03/28, 14:15 - Jhyan: Wait
2020/03/28, 14:15 - Neo: Animation, script, colour pallet
2020/03/28, 14:15 - Jhyan: That could work
2020/03/28, 14:15 - Neo: Idk
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Jhyan: Wait I know
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Neo: Just pay attention to all video
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Neo: And all audio
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Neo: Who do you suggest
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Jhyan: Show it to them and ask them if they'd do anything differently if they were to change it, redirect it, or animate it themselves
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Neo: And since we have so much time we can probably ask a bunch of people
2020/03/28, 14:16 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: Do this first
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: Then show it to them
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: Then ask them this
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Neo: Then show it again
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: No
2020/03/28, 14:17 - Jhyan: Because then they'll look for things that are not there
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Jhyan: They'll create their own problems with it
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Neo: I see
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Neo: So we will have a group of 3 people each
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Jhyan: Maybe if they want to see a detail that they remember, show them that specific detail
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Jhyan: But don't just let them watch the whole thing again
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Jhyan: I'll try get people
2020/03/28, 14:18 - Neo: I'll ask 3 people and you ask 3 people
2020/03/28, 14:19 - Neo: But make sure they arent biased
2020/03/28, 14:19 - Neo: And dont cheat lol
2020/03/28, 14:19 - Jhyan: Yeah they can't have already watched it
2020/03/28, 14:19 - Jhyan: Or something
2020/03/28, 14:19 - Neo: Yeha
2020/03/28, 14:20 - Neo: From 18:26 to 18:09
2020/03/28, 14:20 - Neo: Right
2020/03/28, 14:20 - Jhyan: Wait
2020/03/28, 14:20 - Jhyan: Use the timestamp given when you hover over the bar, not the amount left
2020/03/28, 14:20 - Neo: Ok
2020/03/28, 14:21 - Jhyan: So what timestamp
2020/03/28, 14:23 - Neo: Hm
2020/03/28, 14:23 - Neo: Try 07:47
2020/03/28, 14:25 - Jhyan: My sister didn't think anything of note
2020/03/28, 14:25 - Jhyan: Nah it's fine I just used this
2020/03/28, 14:25 - Neo: To 08:04
2020/03/28, 14:25 - Jhyan: But these are useful if you're gonna tell other people to watch it
2020/03/28, 14:25 - Neo: Ok thank god it's a bit difficult using the slider
2020/03/28, 14:26 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/28, 14:26 - Jhyan: I don't know anyone that would respond quick enough
2020/03/28, 14:38 - Neo: Same
2020/03/28, 14:38 - Neo: Let me ask giume though
2020/03/28, 14:41 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/28, 14:41 - Neo: Giume said the voice acting, facial expressions and the script
2020/03/28, 14:42 - Jhyan: But what would be Chang about that
2020/03/28, 14:42 - Neo: But I will admit that giume and I think the same
2020/03/28, 14:42 - Neo: This
2020/03/28, 14:42 - Jhyan: Yeah what would he actually change it to
2020/03/28, 14:42 - Neo: He would change the voice acting, facial expressions and the script
2020/03/28, 14:43 - Neo: He said he would make the facial expression match the situation instead of the same face through the whole scene
2020/03/28, 14:43 - Neo: And didnt elaborate on the other two
2020/03/28, 14:44 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/03/28, 14:44 - Jhyan: That's not the same problem that you identified
2020/03/28, 14:44 - Jhyan: Your problem was with the timing of the words
2020/03/28, 14:45 - Jhyan: I'm trying to get someone other than family to do this
2020/03/28, 14:45 - Neo: I actually dont know how you get bothered by fortnite's design but not by this
2020/03/28, 14:45 - Neo: Same
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Neo: He said that the script is weird
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Jhyan: Idc about Fortnite's design
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Jhyan: I don't like the movement
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Jhyan: It's clunky
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Neo: Yeah it is kind of gross
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Neo: But this
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Neo: This is almost the same thing
2020/03/28, 14:46 - Jhyan: It's VASTLY different
2020/03/28, 14:47 - Jhyan: I'm not the one moving
2020/03/28, 14:47 - Jhyan: I don't require perfect translation from my hands to the game Avatar
2020/03/28, 14:48 - Neo: Yeah
2020/03/28, 14:49 - Neo: But the point is its something small and only noticable if you pay attention and you are looking for flaws
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Jhyan: I wasn't looking for flaws in Fortnite
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Jhyan: Only when you asked me what I didn't like about it
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Neo: Yeah it's the same for me
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Jhyan: Oh I see now
2020/03/28, 14:50 - Neo: Initially I wasnt looking for flaws
2020/03/28, 14:51 - Jhyan: I think we just have different expectations for what's natural in a show
2020/03/28, 14:51 - Jhyan: So you didn't like it, but it did
2020/03/28, 14:51 - Jhyan: *I
2020/03/28, 14:52 - Jhyan: I'll come back when the person I asked responds
2020/03/28, 14:59 - Neo: Okay same
2020/03/28, 23:43 - Jhyan: Dude Scissor Seven's story is good idk why you said it wasn't
2020/03/29, 08:17 - Neo: No some stuff just happens without reason
2020/03/29, 08:18 - Neo: Like why does he turn into mad dog in the one episode and there was another one that was really bad
2020/03/29, 08:19 - Neo: The story is fine
2020/03/29, 08:21 - Neo: And it could be wwaaaaay better, if they didnt have to condense it down to 12 minute episodes
2020/03/29, 08:21 - Neo: The backstory of 13
2020/04/01, 19:25 - Neo: Yes I love it, the ending isnt that great
2020/04/01, 19:27 - Jhyan: I agree
2020/04/01, 19:27 - Jhyan: Everything except the ending was good
2020/04/01, 19:30 - Neo: And maybe it's a bit stupid to say this but I a major reason I loved this movie is because  it wasnt made in the IS
2020/04/01, 19:30 - Neo: US
2020/04/01, 19:37 - Neo: I think its Spanish
2020/04/01, 19:37 - Neo: I'm not sure
2020/04/01, 19:37 - Jhyan: Yeah it's Spanish
2020/04/01, 19:37 - Jhyan: It was an indie movie
2020/04/01, 19:38 - Jhyan: That's why
2020/04/01, 19:38 - Jhyan: You probably wouldn't mind an American indie movie
2020/04/01, 19:38 - Neo: Yeah?
2020/04/01, 19:39 - Jhyan: I think you mind the effect of big budgets changing movies
2020/04/01, 19:39 - Jhyan: And it's only because America has the only big budget movies
2020/04/01, 19:39 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/03, 13:00 - Neo: Have you seen Mortal Shell
2020/04/03, 13:00 - Neo: Looks pretty interesting
2020/04/03, 13:01 - Jhyan: No
2020/04/03, 13:01 - Jhyan: I'll look at it now
2020/04/03, 13:01 - Neo: Atomic Heart
2020/04/03, 13:01 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Neo: What do you think about Atomic Heart
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Neo: And have you gotten any school work
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Jhyan: It looks really fun
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Jhyan: School is finished for us
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Neo: Yeah same but they still gave us work
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Neo: Like your midterm right
2020/04/03, 13:02 - Jhyan: The enemy concepts are really cool
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Jhyan: No the term is finished
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Neo: I like the designs
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Neo: Really
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Neo: Damn
2020/04/03, 13:03 - Neo: So no work
2020/04/03, 13:04 - Jhyan: Mortal shell looks good
2020/04/03, 13:04 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/03, 13:04 - Neo: But I feel like they are going to fuck it up
2020/04/03, 13:05 - Jhyan: How
2020/04/03, 13:05 - Neo: I dont knwo
2020/04/03, 13:05 - Neo: Just a feeling
2020/04/03, 13:05 - Neo: I hope I'm wrong
2020/04/05, 19:50 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/04/05, 21:38 - Neo: Thank you RWJ
2020/04/06, 20:45 - Neo: Uhuh I saw a snail for the first time in forever today
2020/04/07, 18:08 - Jhyan: Ok so I thought part 1 was good
2020/04/07, 18:08 - Jhyan: They just completely surpassed it with part 2
2020/04/07, 18:08 - Jhyan: Of 7 seeds
2020/04/07, 18:10 - Jhyan: Dude
2020/04/07, 18:10 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/07, 18:10 - Neo: I cant stand it
2020/04/07, 18:10 - Jhyan: You haven't watched part 2
2020/04/07, 18:11 - Neo: Because I cant stand the show
2020/04/07, 18:11 - Neo: What do you think of Steven universe
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Jhyan: I can't stand it
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Jhyan: Jk
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Neo: ?
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Neo: You're allowed to
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Jhyan: Idk I haven't watched it for a long time
2020/04/07, 18:12 - Neo: And I dont like steven universe aswell
2020/04/07, 18:13 - Neo: What do think about what you remember
2020/04/07, 18:13 - Jhyan: The story took too long to develop
2020/04/07, 18:13 - Jhyan: But the art was amazing
2020/04/07, 18:14 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/07, 18:14 - Neo: The art is fine
2020/04/07, 18:14 - Neo: The characters lack consistency
2020/04/07, 18:16 - Neo: Ok what is a show you cant stand
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Jhyan: Friends
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Neo: Ok same
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Jhyan: The Big Bang Theory
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Neo: Yup
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Jhyan: Most shows aren't something I can't stand
2020/04/07, 18:17 - Neo: But I love the memes
2020/04/07, 18:18 - Jhyan: Sometimes they fuck up one thing and it ruins the show, but it's almost never that I just can't stand it
2020/04/07, 18:18 - Neo: There is one where the character with glasses is driving and a horrible cropped clip of sheldon saying "buzinga" and he crashes and screams
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Jhyan: Do you ever wonder if there's a word for a Japanese weeb
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Neo: No
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Jhyan: Like for people who binge too many American shows
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Jhyan: Or who try to act like they're American
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Neo: Probably retarded
2020/04/07, 18:19 - Jhyan: Or Western
2020/04/07, 18:20 - Jhyan: But we have a word besides retarded to describe people who pretend they're Japanese
2020/04/07, 18:20 - Neo: Yeah but being Japanese is better than being American
2020/04/08, 07:20 - Neo: https://youtu.be/OAYXlLCb1qo
2020/04/08, 10:44 - Jhyan: >Nobby has become mayor
2020/04/08, 11:06 - Neo: YYEEAS
2020/04/09, 22:40 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/04/10, 12:54 - Jhyan: You should watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
2020/04/10, 12:54 - Jhyan: You'd like it
2020/04/10, 12:54 - Jhyan: But be warned, the first 10 episodes are horrible compared to the rest of it
2020/04/10, 12:54 - Neo: I dont like any of it
2020/04/10, 12:54 - Jhyan: What
2020/04/10, 12:55 - Neo: I've seen the first 6 episodes and a bit of season 2
2020/04/10, 12:55 - Neo: Jojos
2020/04/10, 12:55 - Jhyan: Yeah I told you, the first episodes are so bad
2020/04/10, 12:55 - Jhyan: I almost didn't watch it
2020/04/10, 12:55 - Neo: And I already know that
2020/04/11, 09:03 - Neo: What do you think about grounded
2020/04/11, 09:03 - Jhyan: What's that
2020/04/11, 09:04 - Neo: It's a game
2020/04/11, 09:04 - Neo: Coming next gen
2020/04/11, 09:04 - Neo: I like it  a lot
2020/04/11, 09:06 - Jhyan: I haven't really seen it
2020/04/11, 09:06 - Neo: I dont think it's been released yet
2020/04/11, 09:06 - Neo: It reminds me of rust
2020/04/11, 09:07 - Jhyan: It reminds me of raft
2020/04/11, 09:13 - Neo: Ye
2020/04/11, 09:14 - Neo: Have you seen the gameplay trailer
2020/04/11, 09:14 - Neo: I think the bald guy is the developer and he acts weird
2020/04/11, 09:14 - Jhyan: Not yet
2020/04/11, 09:15 - Neo: Like he ignores the woman who's playing
2020/04/11, 09:15 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/04/11, 09:17 - Neo: And she sucks
2020/04/11, 09:18 - Jhyan: Lemme go watch it
2020/04/11, 09:19 - Jhyan: Is it the IGN one
2020/04/11, 09:21 - Jhyan: I can't find it
2020/04/11, 09:32 - Neo: Ya
2020/04/11, 09:33 - Neo: IGN
2020/04/11, 09:42 - Jhyan: She's kinda annoying though
2020/04/11, 09:43 - Jhyan: Instead of just commenting on it and asking questions, she just says "it's nice that ..."
2020/04/11, 09:43 - Jhyan: Which is really awkward for the guy because is he supposed to thank her every time? No, because he's supposed to be explaining to the audience
2020/04/11, 09:44 - Jhyan: Also it's a video call, I think all the times he accidentally interrupts her or doesn't reply to her are justified
2020/04/11, 10:01 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:01 - Neo: Did you see when she was fighting the orb weaver
2020/04/11, 10:02 - Jhyan: No
2020/04/11, 10:02 - Jhyan: The video was 44 minutes long
2020/04/11, 10:02 - Jhyan: I didn't watch the whole thing
2020/04/11, 10:02 - Neo: No it's like 6 mins in
2020/04/11, 10:02 - Neo: She has a bow
2020/04/11, 10:03 - Neo: But fires the arrow way off target
2020/04/11, 10:03 - Neo: Let me get a time stamp
2020/04/11, 10:03 - Neo: At 14:10
2020/04/11, 10:04 - Neo: Yeah the interaction is pretty awkward
2020/04/11, 10:05 - Jhyan: Nothing about that was awkward
2020/04/11, 10:07 - Neo: Maybe awkward is exaggerating but its weird how she's fighting the spider and the guy is trying explain certain things and she just ignores him
2020/04/11, 10:07 - Jhyan: He started explaining the anthill
2020/04/11, 10:07 - Jhyan: And then he switched to the spider
2020/04/11, 10:08 - Neo: Because the gamer isnt listening
2020/04/11, 10:09 - Jhyan: Or it could've been latency in the video call
2020/04/11, 10:09 - Jhyan: So she just didn't respond quick enough
2020/04/11, 10:09 - Neo: Probably
2020/04/11, 10:09 - Neo: Does the game intrest you
2020/04/11, 10:10 - Jhyan: Not as a singleplayer game
2020/04/11, 10:10 - Neo: Oh yeah same
2020/04/11, 10:10 - Neo: I dont think I could play this by myself for too long
2020/04/11, 10:11 - Jhyan: Mortal shell did look engaging though
2020/04/11, 10:12 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:12 - Neo: Probably going to be crazy over priced
2020/04/11, 10:13 - Jhyan: I hate that
2020/04/11, 10:13 - Jhyan: Games are way too expensive these days
2020/04/11, 10:13 - Jhyan: And it's not just because of inflation
2020/04/11, 10:13 - Jhyan: They've been pushing the limits of what people can pay to maximize profits
2020/04/11, 10:14 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:14 - Jhyan: How do you justify 1k per game
2020/04/11, 10:14 - Neo: Maybe the effort they put into the game
2020/04/11, 10:14 - Jhyan: Except that's far from the truth
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Jhyan: That money doesn't go to the developers
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Neo: I'll never understand why developers hire famous voice actors
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Jhyan: It goes to the executives
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Neo: Really
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Neo: What about indie games
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Neo: But those dont get expensive
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Jhyan: Indie games don't charge that much
2020/04/11, 10:15 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:16 - Jhyan: But that just proves that it's possible to have a game be 100 bucks without starving the developers
2020/04/11, 10:16 - Neo: Yea
2020/04/11, 10:17 - Neo: What about distribution costs
2020/04/11, 10:17 - Jhyan: Those only exist for consoles
2020/04/11, 10:17 - Neo: Idk who still buys physical copies anymore but I do know people still sell them
2020/04/11, 10:17 - Neo: Yeah but they still have to sell them
2020/04/11, 10:18 - Neo: Maybe that's why indie games on PC dont cost that much
2020/04/11, 10:18 - Jhyan: But they don't
2020/04/11, 10:18 - Jhyan: They only need to sell as much as people buy them
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Jhyan: Demand has gone down so the supply should too
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Jhyan: It's likely that it was necessary to have high prices at a point
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Neo: Its the GameStop and BTgames that buy the copiess
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Neo: And they make the estimate
2020/04/11, 10:19 - Jhyan: And they just kept charging, even when the costs went down
2020/04/11, 10:20 - Neo: Yeah GameStop should go out of business just like block busters
2020/04/11, 10:21 - Jhyan: It will
2020/04/11, 10:22 - Neo: When do you think that would happen
2020/04/11, 10:23 - Jhyan: Idk I haven't analysed their business performance
2020/04/11, 10:24 - Jhyan: Plus they might never go out of business fully
2020/04/11, 10:24 - Jhyan: They might just become an online store that commissions physical copies or something
2020/04/11, 10:25 - Neo: But if you wers to guess right now what would it be
2020/04/11, 10:25 - Neo: What is the point of that
2020/04/11, 10:25 - Jhyan: Idk 5 years
2020/04/11, 10:25 - Jhyan: For people who like to build huge shelves of all their games
2020/04/11, 10:25 - Jhyan: Collectors
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Neo: Oh yeah
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Jhyan: It would be like a collector item shop
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Jhyan: And that too
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Neo: They do make collector's editions
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Jhyan: I've seen BTgames selling pop vinyl figures and stuff
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Neo: That's probably going to be the only target audience?
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Neo: Idk if those are the right words
2020/04/11, 10:26 - Neo: Yeah merchandise
2020/04/11, 10:27 - Jhyan: But they'd still make a profit
2020/04/11, 10:28 - Neo: Yeah it's not like that kind of stock expires
2020/04/11, 10:30 - Neo: Okay so the gamer starts asking real questions at 22:00
2020/04/11, 10:30 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/04/11, 10:30 - Jhyan: I'm not gonna watch the whole thing though
2020/04/11, 10:30 - Jhyan: I already get the premise
2020/04/11, 10:31 - Jhyan: If you ever get MC on a PC we should do the hunger games thing again
2020/04/11, 10:31 - Neo: I'm definitely going to
2020/04/11, 10:31 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Neo: Oh the environment interacts with itself
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Jhyan: So you're not gonna get the PS5
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Neo: So like different insect might fight each other
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Neo: No ways
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Neo: I think I'm more likely to get the xbox
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Jhyan: I still haven't made you a parts list actually
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Jhyan: I started but then I got distracted
2020/04/11, 10:32 - Neo: But I want to sell my games and such
2020/04/11, 10:33 - Neo: Its cool take your time
2020/04/11, 10:35 - Neo: But I think I'm going to have to lower the budget to 10k
2020/04/11, 10:35 - Neo: 9k
2020/04/11, 20:11 - Neo: Compare Nosedive (S3 E1 - Black Mirror) to App Developments and Condiments (S5 E8 - Community)
2020/04/11, 20:12 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/04/11, 20:12 - Neo: When you have time
2020/04/11, 20:12 - Jhyan: I thought school was over why are you making me write an essay
2020/04/11, 20:13 - Neo: No it's just that the start of the Community episode is really similar to Nosedive
2020/04/11, 20:13 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/04/11, 20:13 - Neo: You can just watch the first 5 mins of the community episode
2020/04/14, 22:41 - Jhyan: https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/comments/g0fdtw/obama_kinda_vibin_doe/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
2020/04/14, 22:57 - Neo: Bwumbwum
2020/04/14, 23:22 - Jhyan: Did you watch it
2020/04/14, 23:22 - Neo: Yeah I've seen it before lmao
2020/04/14, 23:23 - Neo: Why does it have so many awards
2020/04/14, 23:24 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/04/14, 23:25 - Neo: Have you ever paid for any of those
2020/04/14, 23:25 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/04/14, 23:25 - Jhyan: With what card lmao
2020/04/14, 23:25 - Neo: Have you ever gotten 1
2020/04/14, 23:28 - Jhyan: No
2020/04/14, 23:29 - Neo: Dang
2020/04/14, 23:29 - Neo: Missed voice call
2020/04/14, 23:30 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/04/14, 23:30 - Neo: Dis is my greatest reddit achievement
2020/04/14, 23:30 - Jhyan: You downvoted yourself
2020/04/14, 23:30 - Neo: Yeah
2020/04/14, 23:31 - Neo: To get to -69
2020/04/17, 17:31 - Jhyan: Remember Boneworks
2020/04/17, 17:31 - Neo: Ya, the VR game
2020/04/17, 17:31 - Jhyan: The game that made you admit that VR isn't just a gimmick anymore
2020/04/17, 17:32 - Jhyan: Half Life: Alyx is sooooo much better
2020/04/17, 17:32 - Jhyan: Valve really did well with it
2020/04/17, 17:32 - Neo: Yeah? It isnt too linear
2020/04/17, 17:32 - Jhyan: I mean yeah
2020/04/17, 17:32 - Jhyan: But in terms of VR mechanics, graphics and stability
2020/04/17, 17:33 - Neo: Oh yea
2020/04/17, 17:33 - Jhyan: Like it feels way more intuitive
2020/04/17, 17:33 - Jhyan: The only negative thing I have about it is that you can't interact with enough items
2020/04/17, 17:34 - Neo: I think I saw a bit of donkeys gameplay
2020/04/17, 17:34 - Jhyan: Like there will be a radio or something and you can't even flick the switches on it unless it's part of the story
2020/04/17, 17:34 - Neo: Is that a good thing
2020/04/17, 17:34 - Jhyan: Which is fine for traditional games, but with VR, you need to take a different approach to user interaction
2020/04/17, 17:35 - Neo: It doesnt seem like a good selling point
2020/04/17, 17:35 - Jhyan: It's just really really disappointing when you put something in the same that seems like it would be interactable and then not have it be
2020/04/17, 17:35 - Jhyan: But that's a really small complaint against the positives
2020/04/17, 17:35 - Neo: Yeah I know what you mean
2020/04/17, 17:36 - Jhyan: And it's not necessarily exclusive to HLA, most games haven't done it
2020/04/17, 17:36 - Neo: Is it a sequel to the half life series
2020/04/17, 17:36 - Neo: Or a prequel
2020/04/17, 17:36 - Neo: Or unrelated
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Jhyan: It's a conquel
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Jhyan: Idk if that's a thing
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Neo: ?
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Jhyan: But it's set between hl1 and hl2
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Neo: Ye what is that
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/04/17, 17:37 - Neo: Se-pre-quel
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Jhyan: Pre-sequel
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Jhyan: Like Borderlands
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Neo: Does it offer a lot of lorr
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Neo: Uhuh
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Neo: Lore
2020/04/17, 17:38 - Jhyan: Idk I haven't played the first two because they look like ass and if they want me to play them they're gonna have to remaster them
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Neo: Oh
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Neo: I thought it was a rite of passage
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Jhyan: But the story seems solid, considering the reviews commend it
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Neo: For PC gamers lmao
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Jhyan: Apparently the ending is killer
2020/04/17, 17:39 - Neo: Have you seen smoling friends
2020/04/17, 17:40 - Jhyan: Well I've forsaken tradition
2020/04/17, 17:40 - Jhyan: No
2020/04/17, 17:40 - Jhyan: Is that a typo
2020/04/17, 17:40 - Jhyan: Is it supposed to be smiling
2020/04/17, 17:40 - Neo: Smiling Friends is  a project made by a youtube animator and the show aired on AdultSwim
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Neo: Or may continue to
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Jhyan: Should I watch it
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Neo: Ye ya smiling friends
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Jhyan: What did you think of Infinity Train again
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Neo: I thought it was really good
2020/04/17, 17:41 - Jhyan: Same
2020/04/17, 17:42 - Neo: It breaks away from the predictable TV shows that air on the channel
2020/04/17, 17:42 - Neo: No I thought smiling friends was really good
2020/04/17, 17:42 - Neo: But Infinity Train was fine
2020/04/17, 17:42 - Neo: I really liked the pilot
2020/04/17, 17:42 - Neo: Actually I still liked infinity train
2020/04/17, 17:43 - Neo: I dont remember much
2020/04/17, 17:43 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/04/17, 17:43 - Jhyan: Well I'll try watch smiling friends
2020/04/17, 17:44 - Neo: Yes
2020/04/17, 17:44 - Neo: Also I liked the first 3 seasons of community
2020/04/20, 16:24 - Neo: Check out Midnight gospel aswell
2020/04/20, 17:39 - Jhyan: I just saw that
2020/04/20, 17:39 - Jhyan: I didn't watch it
2020/04/20, 17:40 - Neo: I like the visuals but the dialogue is just characters talking about dick
2020/04/20, 17:40 - Neo: Dick as in nothing
2020/04/20, 17:40 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/04/20, 17:40 - Jhyan: I'll look at it later
2020/04/20, 17:40 - Neo: But Pendleton Ward works on it
2020/04/20, 17:41 - Jhyan: What's that
2020/04/20, 17:41 - Jhyan: Who
2020/04/20, 17:42 - Neo: Hes an animator
2020/04/20, 17:42 - Neo: Worked on adventure time
2020/04/20, 18:05 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/04/20, 22:53 - Neo: https://youtu.be/dXp3BXTPesQ
2020/04/21, 09:10 - Jhyan: That was pretty funny
2020/04/21, 09:12 - Neo: Ye Eric andre is v funny
2020/04/21, 09:13 - Jhyan: "why... Why did you do that?"
2020/04/21, 09:13 - Neo: I can't remember my Gmail password
2020/04/29, 09:24 - Neo: Jhyan
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Neo: You should try watching community
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Neo: It isnt a bad show at all
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Neo: The first 3 seasons are really good
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Neo: The other three are fine
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Jhyan: Maybe
2020/04/29, 09:25 - Jhyan: I need to finish other stuff first
2020/04/29, 09:26 - Neo: Ye what are ya watching
2020/04/29, 09:26 - Neo: Are ya winning son
2020/04/29, 09:26 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>

2020/04/29, 09:28 - Neo: I was looking 4 that
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Neo: 1
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Neo: Or the one where hes dead on the table
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Jhyan: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, His Dark Materials, Giri Haji, two other shows
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Jhyan: Idk there might be more
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Neo: Hmm 🤔
2020/04/29, 09:28 - Jhyan: Damn I only saw this one
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Jhyan: But JoJo is so good
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Jhyan: You need to watch it
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Jhyan: It deserves all the praise it gets
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Neo: I watched the entire 1st season
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Jhyan: Yeah it gets better after that
2020/04/29, 09:29 - Neo: And then I just couldn't with the second
2020/04/29, 09:30 - Jhyan: That's been reportedly the biggest hurdle
2020/04/29, 09:30 - Neo: I really like the music
2020/04/29, 09:30 - Jhyan: They must've gotten a budget increase or something after season 1
2020/04/29, 09:30 - Jhyan: Because it gets so much better
2020/04/29, 09:30 - Neo: Probably
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Jhyan: I also didn't really like it during season 1
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Neo: I didnt like season 2
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Jhyan: You didn't even watch it
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Neo: I really liked the 1st season
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Neo: I just dont like the filler
2020/04/29, 09:31 - Neo: Or that scene where speedwagon dies
2020/04/29, 09:32 - Neo: Yeah I didnt like the start
2020/04/29, 09:32 - Jhyan: Wait
2020/04/29, 09:32 - Neo: I barely remember it
2020/04/29, 09:32 - Jhyan: Do you mean part 2 or season 2
2020/04/29, 09:32 - Jhyan: Is it Joseph or Jotaro
2020/04/29, 09:33 - Neo: Idek
2020/04/29, 09:33 - Jhyan: Because for me part 2 was at least enjoyable, but it wasn't as amazing as season 2 onwards
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Jhyan: Were they still using Hamon
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Neo: Yes
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Jhyan: Yeah that's part 2 then
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Neo: That's what bothered me
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Neo: I was told I could skip it
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Jhyan: Yeah just skip it then if you want
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Jhyan: Go to Stardust Crusaders
2020/04/29, 09:34 - Jhyan: That's season 2
2020/04/29, 09:36 - Neo: No I was told to skip season 2
2020/04/29, 09:36 - Jhyan: There's no way
2020/04/29, 09:36 - Neo: I mean part 2
2020/04/29, 09:36 - Jhyan: That's what I meant
2020/04/29, 09:36 - Neo: Ye I realised lol
2020/04/29, 09:37 - Jhyan: Season 2 is where all the memes come from
2020/04/29, 09:37 - Neo: Ye
2020/05/01, 07:39 - Neo: It's actually impressive how quickly the team rolled it out, most regions didnt have to wait long and almost everyone got experience it
2020/05/01, 08:08 - Jhyan: Yeah dude
2020/05/01, 08:08 - Jhyan: There wasn't even any ping on the servers
2020/05/01, 10:45 - Neo: Hope we can expect more high effort in-game events like this again
2020/05/01, 22:07 - Neo: ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
2020/05/04, 15:03 - Neo: I realised that it's a common trait for dubbed content to be unbearable to listen to
2020/05/04, 15:04 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/05/04, 15:04 - Jhyan: Only when the lips don't sync up
2020/05/04, 15:04 - Jhyan: In anime it's easy to do that, and I've never seen them not do it
2020/05/04, 15:04 - Neo: Yeah it doesnt excuse the voice acting in 7 Seeds but it's more common than youd think
2020/05/04, 15:05 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/05/04, 15:05 - Jhyan: It's just you
2020/05/04, 15:05 - Neo: Yeah literally everything that wasnt already shot in English will be weird to see dubbed
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Jhyan: The only dub I couldn't stand was JoJo's Bizarre adventure
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Neo: Maybe Castlevania is the only exception
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Jhyan: Castlevania is Western
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Neo: Yeah I was watching JoJos
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Neo: Ohhh that's why
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Neo: It is on netflix
2020/05/04, 15:06 - Neo: In Europe I think
2020/05/04, 15:07 - Jhyan: But the very fact that I don't see a difference in quality between that and any other anime I've watched dubbed, relative to their budget, is a testament to the fact that you're wrong
2020/05/04, 15:07 - Jhyan: It's on Netflix here
2020/05/04, 15:07 - Jhyan: Like if an anime is smaller scale it'll have a worse dub
2020/05/04, 15:07 - Neo: Yes
2020/05/04, 15:07 - Jhyan: But it's relative to its scale
2020/05/04, 15:08 - Neo: Is jojos under budgeted
2020/05/04, 15:08 - Jhyan: Attack on Titan's dub is amazing, whereas the dub to some small anime is not
2020/05/04, 15:08 - Neo: Is 7 seeds also under budgeted
2020/05/04, 15:08 - Jhyan: Probably in the first season
2020/05/04, 15:09 - Neo: Yes but I was watching the last episode and it was really bad
2020/05/04, 15:09 - Jhyan: That's the only part I watched it dubbed
2020/05/04, 15:09 - Neo: Latest episode on netflix rather
2020/05/04, 15:09 - Jhyan: They had really bad English accents because the first JoJo was English
2020/05/04, 15:09 - Jhyan: I think they either hired bad voice actors or it was Americans trying to do English accents
2020/05/04, 15:10 - Neo: Idk dont remember
2020/05/04, 15:10 - Neo: And dont care
2020/05/04, 15:11 - Neo: But my original point is almost all dubs are awkward
2020/05/04, 15:11 - Neo: And yucky
2020/05/04, 15:11 - Jhyan: Yeah your original point is only you
2020/05/04, 15:11 - Jhyan: And subbed fans that think they're special
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Neo: Na, that's why lots of people watch subbed
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Jhyan: So they delude themselves into thinking that there must be something wrong with dubbed
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Jhyan: Lots of people watched dubbed too dude
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Neo: Sometimes the dubbed version is disgusting
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Neo: Yeah in rewatching Ajin in dubbed
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Jhyan: Yeah but the "sometimes" is the key there
2020/05/04, 15:12 - Neo: Yes
2020/05/04, 15:13 - Jhyan: It's how humans are wired. Throughout all of history there have been groups that say another is inferior because they want to be special or the party in control wants to unite them against something
2020/05/04, 15:14 - Neo: Ok
2020/05/04, 15:14 - Neo: I'm not disagreeing
2020/05/04, 15:14 - Jhyan: Like I can point out huge detriments in experience with watching subbed
2020/05/04, 15:15 - Neo: Ye?
2020/05/04, 15:15 - Jhyan: You don't appreciate the artwork as much because you're constantly reading
2020/05/04, 15:16 - Neo: I guess
2020/05/04, 15:16 - Jhyan: Just like you can say that you lose some of the original emphasis in the language
2020/05/04, 15:16 - Jhyan: With dubbed
2020/05/04, 15:16 - Neo: This is a good point
2020/05/04, 15:17 - Jhyan: Neither one is definitively worse, it's just that people weigh up the pros and cons differently
2020/05/04, 15:17 - Jhyan: And that's why there's two sides to this argument in the first place
2020/05/04, 15:17 - Neo: Ye all about perspective
2020/05/04, 15:17 - Jhyan: If one was objectively better then only that one would exist
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Neo: Well
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Neo: One is better
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Neo: If you understand the language
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/05/04, 15:18 - Neo: Original language
2020/05/04, 15:19 - Jhyan: But then you're not really watching it in a particular way, you're just watching it
2020/05/04, 15:19 - Neo: Did you like the animation for Ajin
2020/05/04, 15:19 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Neo: Even from the start
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Jhyan: It was refreshing that it was 3D
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Jhyan: Why
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Neo: A lot of people hated it
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Neo: A LOT
2020/05/04, 15:20 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Neo: I think it might be the only reason I actually started to watch it
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Jhyan: They made a new Ghost in The Shell thing
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Jhyan: And it has similar animation
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Neo: Back in 2016 I saw a jif on 9gag and people were bashing it
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Neo: Saying it wasnt a real anime
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Jhyan: Like an original Japanese creation, not eesternised
2020/05/04, 15:21 - Neo: Yeah I saw it
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Juf
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Jif
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Jif
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Juf
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Jhyan: Idc if it's real anime or not it was enjoyable to watch
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Yes exactly
2020/05/04, 15:22 - Neo: Ignorance is a plague
2020/05/04, 15:23 - Jhyan: I don't get why they didn't just watch it as a piece of "Japanese entertainment media" instead
2020/05/04, 15:24 - Neo: I guess it doesnt count as an anime
2020/05/04, 15:24 - Neo: Idk
2020/05/04, 15:24 - Jhyan: Yeah that's why they should've just not called it one but watched it anyway
2020/05/04, 15:25 - Jhyan: Like if there's a Japanese live action series they're not gonna freak out and be like "THAT'S NOT AN ANIME"
2020/05/04, 15:25 - Neo: The definition of anime is Japanese animation style
2020/05/04, 15:25 - Jhyan: They'll either watch it or not watch it
2020/05/04, 15:26 - Neo: It really doesnt matter but not watching something because it doesnt fit into a specific category is dum
2020/05/04, 15:26 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Jhyan: The next Rick and Morty episode is coming on the 6th
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Jhyan: On Netflix
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Jhyan: It's out in the US though
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Neo: Oh yeah the season wasnt fully released
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Neo: Rn?
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Neo: Rn Rn?
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Jhyan: You can go pirate it
2020/05/04, 15:28 - Neo: I'm going to watch it with a VPN
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Jhyan: But I want to add to the analytics
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Jhyan: Also pirated versions are only 720p rn
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Neo: Yuck
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Jhyan: When I used a VPN one time Netflix wouldn't let me enter the site
2020/05/04, 15:29 - Neo: That is weird
2020/05/04, 15:30 - Neo: What VPN was it
2020/05/04, 15:35 - Neo: Cant see it
2020/05/04, 15:36 - Neo: There isnt a single episode of the show
2020/05/05, 17:56 - Neo: Have you seen impact
2020/05/05, 17:58 - Jhyan: No
2020/05/05, 17:58 - Jhyan: What is it
2020/05/05, 17:59 - Neo: The game
2020/05/05, 17:59 - Neo: I saw little bit
2020/05/05, 17:59 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/05/05, 17:59 - Neo: It reminds me of my friend pedro
2020/05/05, 18:04 - Jhyan: I'll check it out with I can
2020/05/05, 18:04 - Neo: Ye ok
2020/05/07, 15:57 - Neo: New season of Scissor Seven is out
2020/05/07, 15:58 - Neo: But it looks like none of it is in English
2020/05/07, 16:15 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/05/07, 16:15 - Jhyan: I wasn't watching it dubbed anyway
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Neo: Really
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Jhyan: Coz it's Chinese
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Neo: Its pretty impressive voice acting
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Jhyan: Yeah I know
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Jhyan: But it felt better in dubbed
2020/05/07, 16:16 - Jhyan: I tried it in both but I preferred dubbed
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Jhyan: Plus the dialogue wasn't complicated so
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Neo: Seven has a Chinese accent
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Jhyan: I know
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Jhyan: It was quite good
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Jhyan: That he wasn't American
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Neo: There are still Americans in the cast
2020/05/07, 16:17 - Neo: I think
2020/05/07, 16:22 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/07, 16:22 - Jhyan: Did you watch it dubbed
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Jhyan: Oh yeah I think what mostly ruined the dub was that they took a completely different approach to the bird
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Jhyan: He was like a Texan American in the dubbed
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Neo: Yes
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Neo: I didnt actually know that it was dubbed
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Jhyan: But he was supposed to be a wise master in the Chinese audio
2020/05/07, 16:23 - Neo: Or I was never conscious of it
2020/05/07, 16:24 - Neo: I knew the show was Chinese
2020/05/07, 16:24 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/08, 08:46 - Neo: Brass monkey
2020/05/08, 08:46 - Neo: That funky monkey
2020/05/08, 08:46 - Jhyan: Wait I'm going school stuff
2020/05/09, 19:26 - Neo: Ajins manga is better than the
2020/05/09, 19:29 - Jhyan: Than the what
2020/05/09, 19:29 - Neo: The show lol
2020/05/09, 19:29 - Neo: It has it's weird moments
2020/05/09, 19:30 - Jhyan: Lol
2020/05/09, 19:30 - Jhyan: Yeah but manga is too annoying to read
2020/05/09, 19:30 - Jhyan: At least digitally
2020/05/09, 19:30 - Neo: I dont think it's that bad
2020/05/09, 19:30 - Neo: No but the manga is ongoing
2020/05/09, 19:31 - Neo: and buying it is so dumb to me
2020/05/09, 19:31 - Jhyan: Yeah I won't buy it
2020/05/09, 19:31 - Jhyan: There's too many
2020/05/09, 19:31 - Jhyan: Maybe for a short series I would buy
2020/05/09, 19:32 - Neo: Yeah and I doubt anywhere near by has them so the go to option is buying them online
2020/05/13, 16:12 - Jhyan: How do you deal with mosquitoes
2020/05/13, 16:12 - Neo: Gun
2020/05/13, 16:12 - Jhyan: No
2020/05/13, 16:13 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/05/13, 16:13 - Neo: Idk
2020/05/13, 16:13 - Neo: I just hide under my blanket
2020/05/13, 16:13 - Jhyan: But how do you kill them
2020/05/13, 16:13 - Neo: Slam
2020/05/13, 16:30 - Jhyan: reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard
2020/05/13, 16:30 - Jhyan: That's exactly your type of memes
2020/05/13, 16:31 - Neo: The homophobia one is good
2020/05/13, 16:32 - Jhyan: Where
2020/05/13, 16:32 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/05/13, 16:32 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/05/13, 16:32 - Jhyan: Sort it by top of all time
2020/05/13, 16:36 - Neo: Ye
2020/05/13, 16:36 - Neo: Some arent that good
2020/05/19, 15:33 - Jhyan: We all got complimentary skins for the event
2020/05/19, 15:33 - Jhyan: A face mask design
2020/05/19, 15:34 - Neo: Yeah a bit simplistic
2020/05/19, 15:34 - Neo: But I still appreciate it
2020/05/19, 15:34 - Jhyan: But it helped promote the event, and selected players with specialties related to the event got better versions of the skin
2020/05/19, 15:35 - Neo: And the fact that the devs rolled them out pretty quickly
2020/05/19, 15:35 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/05/19, 15:35 - Neo: I think that's why they had to go for a simplistic design
2020/05/19, 15:36 - Jhyan: Not all players chose to claim the skin until they released patch notes about the minor buff
2020/05/19, 15:37 - Jhyan: And then large player factions made it mandatory
2020/05/19, 15:39 - Neo: Yeah some regions are locked so you cant even show off your outfit mixtures
2020/05/19, 15:39 - Neo: Or outfit combos with the mask
2020/05/28, 17:23 - Neo: GN
2020/05/28, 17:23 - Neo: Watch Dorohedoro
2020/05/28, 17:23 - Neo: Very cool
2020/05/28, 17:24 - Jhyan: What's that
2020/05/28, 17:24 - Neo: New anime inspired show on Netflix
2020/05/28, 17:25 - Jhyan: Ok I'll try watch it later
2020/05/28, 17:25 - Neo: Yeeeesss
2020/05/28, 17:26 - Neo: Also a bit of more good news, I should have enough money for the PC in a year
2020/05/28, 17:36 - Jhyan: Oh nice
2020/05/28, 17:37 - Jhyan: I didn't send you the specs
2020/05/28, 17:37 - Jhyan: I have an incomplete list so I can send it if you want
2020/05/28, 17:37 - Neo: Uh yeah sure
2020/05/28, 17:39 - Jhyan: K I'll send it later
2020/05/29, 18:39 - Jhyan: How good is it
2020/05/29, 18:39 - Jhyan: Scale of 1 to 14
2020/05/29, 18:39 - Jhyan: scale of cat to dog
2020/05/29, 18:39 - Neo: I really like it
2020/05/29, 18:39 - Jhyan: scale of kg to celsius
2020/05/29, 18:40 - Neo: So I'd say 10
2020/05/29, 18:40 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/05/29, 18:40 - Neo: Out of 14 lol
2020/05/29, 18:40 - Neo: So 7/10
2020/05/29, 18:41 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/05/29, 18:41 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/05/29, 18:41 - Jhyan: What about on a scale of cat to dog
2020/05/29, 18:41 - Neo: I'd say hyena
2020/05/29, 18:41 - Neo: Quite a dog but very cat looking
2020/05/29, 18:42 - Jhyan: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/24GZEAGMWY7LJ?ref_=wl_share
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Jhyan: Maybe the GPU or CPU has to be less expensive to get the monitor and stuff
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Jhyan: I don't remember if you wanted that on the list
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Neo: Who is Neo Smith
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Jhyan: You
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Neo: Hm 🤔
2020/05/29, 18:43 - Jhyan: I don't remember why but there was a reason not to put your real name
2020/05/29, 18:44 - Jhyan: They were gonna try and link it with another account or something
2020/05/29, 18:45 - Neo: Oh alright
2020/05/29, 18:46 - Neo: Thanks but a lot of the stuff cant be ordered to my location
2020/05/29, 18:46 - Neo: Is there an alternative
2020/05/29, 18:46 - Neo: Or is that because of the virus
2020/05/29, 18:50 - Neo: What is an OEM DVD
2020/05/29, 19:20 - Jhyan: Yeah it's just that it stopped being like that
2020/05/29, 19:20 - Jhyan: It was available to deliver here before
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: It means it can't be resold
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: I just googled it
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: Just find stuff with the same specs
2020/05/29, 19:21 - Jhyan: A lot of it can be bought here
2020/05/29, 19:22 - Neo: Yeah okay
2020/05/29, 19:22 - Neo: Thanks man
2020/05/29, 19:22 - Jhyan: There's this Indian guy at this one market that sells a bunch of gaming parts where I got my stuff
2020/05/29, 19:22 - Jhyan: Amazon is too expensive, it's just to get the stuff you can't get here or to quickly find things you want
2020/05/29, 19:26 - Neo: In Johannesburg I assume
2020/05/29, 19:26 - Neo: Pls link it
2020/05/29, 19:29 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/05/29, 19:29 - Jhyan: Let me ask my dad
2020/05/29, 19:30 - Jhyan: But also he's kinda pushy and tries to upsell you
2020/05/29, 19:30 - Jhyan: Like I know that's stereotypical but it's true in this case
2020/05/29, 19:31 - Neo: Lol yeah that's a lot of self owned businesses
2020/05/29, 19:31 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/05/29, 19:31 - Jhyan: I asked my dad what the market is called
2020/05/29, 19:32 - Jhyan: He'll get back to me
2020/05/29, 19:32 - Neo: Yeah lol no rush
2020/05/29, 19:32 - Neo: Thanks again
2020/05/30, 11:47 - Jhyan: Boksburg market. His name is Salman. I think it's comet computers, on the internet.
2020/05/30, 11:47 - Jhyan: Or comax
2020/06/02, 18:23 - Neo: Did you see my recent tweet
2020/06/02, 18:24 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/06/02, 18:24 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/02, 18:26 - Neo: Look at it

2020/06/02, 18:29 - Neo: Did you find it funny
2020/06/02, 19:08 - Jhyan: He's
2020/06/02, 19:08 - Jhyan: *yes
2020/06/02, 19:08 - Jhyan: But at least it doesn't instantly post it
2020/06/02, 19:08 - Neo: Yeah that would be a bit much
2020/06/02, 19:08 - Neo: And possibly illegal
2020/06/02, 19:09 - Neo: Or at least sounds illegal
2020/06/02, 19:10 - Jhyan: Yes it probably is
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Neo: Have you seen Ready Or Not
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Neo: Looks like complete shit
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Jhyan: Nope
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Jhyan: What is it
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Neo: But they have this non-lethal mechanic
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Neo: Fps
2020/06/04, 22:15 - Neo: Where you can some-what detain the enemy
2020/06/04, 22:16 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/06/04, 22:16 - Jhyan: Explain it to me, I don't want to do research
2020/06/04, 22:23 - Neo: Very small company with a  smaller dev team is attempting to make a fps game, 5v5 type of thing (similar CS or R6) but they want to add some pretty fresh mechanics like a body cam thingy, where you can spectate a team mate without having to die, the character you play as pulls out a tablet-ipad looking device which shows a delayed view of a team mate and you can bring a taser or "bean bag" shot gun as non lethals and I think the non lethals inflicts some kind of stun damage and I assume the screen gets distorted when you get hit by them and whilst the enemy is disoriented you can handcuff them and they can only walk around on their knees. Pretty cool in my opinion
2020/06/04, 22:24 - Jhyan: Then why did you say it looks like complete shit
2020/06/04, 22:24 - Neo: The game itself
2020/06/04, 22:24 - Neo: Full of bugs
2020/06/04, 22:25 - Neo: It's still in a pre-release state
2020/06/04, 22:25 - Neo: And the maps are so low res
2020/06/04, 22:25 - Jhyan: But why are you judging it then
2020/06/04, 22:25 - Jhyan: Anyway I haven't seen it
2020/06/04, 22:26 - Neo: It does look like shot though...
2020/06/04, 22:26 - Jhyan: But you made it seem like it was some game you didn't think was good
2020/06/04, 22:26 - Neo: Maybe because it's a small company but I really dont know why they are revealing so much
2020/06/04, 22:26 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/06/04, 22:26 - Neo: It looks like there is so much they still need to do
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Jhyan: Compare that to No Man's Sky lol
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Neo: Did you see gameplay
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Jhyan: Where they somehow made it look amazing
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Neo: What do you mean
2020/06/04, 22:28 - Neo: As in pre-release state
2020/06/04, 22:29 - Jhyan: Yeah they released gameplay that looked super good years before it released
2020/06/04, 22:29 - Jhyan: And at release it was pretty bad
2020/06/04, 22:30 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLcjvIQJns0
2020/06/04, 22:31 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLtmEjqzg7M
2020/06/04, 22:31 - Neo: Wow that gameplay actually looks good
2020/06/04, 22:32 - Jhyan: Look at the E3 trailer it was even better
2020/06/04, 22:32 - Neo: Yeahh
2020/06/04, 22:32 - Neo: 1 game I really cant wait to see release and evolve is Grounded
2020/06/04, 22:33 - Jhyan: Idk what that is either
2020/06/04, 22:33 - Neo: Ye but I showed you:(
2020/06/04, 22:34 - Neo: Nvm that was giume
2020/06/04, 22:34 - Jhyan: No Man's Sky, Anthem, Just Cause 4, Destiny 2 etc. are why I don't follow games before they're released anymore
2020/06/04, 22:34 - Jhyan: No Man's Sky actually redeemed themselves though
2020/06/04, 22:34 - Neo: I really hope they release the whole game
2020/06/04, 22:34 - Jhyan: Because they weren't a greedy corporation
2020/06/04, 22:35 - Neo: Instead of crappy dlc like the scummy capitalist pigs I expect them to be
2020/06/04, 22:35 - Neo: Well
2020/06/04, 22:36 - Neo: I guess they could have just run away with all the money
2020/06/04, 22:36 - Neo: But I at least expect what I see right
2020/06/04, 22:36 - Neo: Jesus anthem was such a fuck up
2020/06/04, 22:36 - Jhyan: Yeah but it was also complicated
2020/06/04, 22:37 - Jhyan: They got sponsored by Sony and had to release super early
2020/06/04, 22:37 - Jhyan: From the corporate pressure
2020/06/04, 22:37 - Jhyan: Yeah that game looked so good
2020/06/04, 22:37 - Neo: Yeah
2020/06/04, 22:40 - Jhyan: What did they actually release
2020/06/04, 22:40 - Jhyan: I didn't even see
2020/06/04, 22:40 - Neo: I dont know
2020/06/04, 22:40 - Neo: Fuckin disappeared
2020/06/07, 23:50 - Neo: https://youtu.be/-Jm8bN9wwgY
2020/06/08, 00:04 - Jhyan: What did you just send me
2020/06/08, 00:04 - Jhyan: Get it out of here
2020/06/08, 00:04 - Neo: The orfice
2020/06/08, 00:05 - Neo: Orefoce
2020/06/08, 00:06 - Jhyan: Offorce
2020/06/08, 00:06 - Neo: Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
2020/06/08, 17:23 - Jhyan: What was that crappy free PS4 fighting game you made me get
2020/06/08, 17:23 - Neo: Not crappy
2020/06/08, 17:23 - Neo: Let It Die
2020/06/08, 17:24 - Neo: Very fun
2020/06/08, 17:24 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/06/08, 17:24 - Jhyan: Anyway I found a game called Code Vein which reminds me of it but it's way better
2020/06/08, 17:24 - Jhyan: And it's very fun
2020/06/08, 17:25 - Neo: Looks more cartoonish
2020/06/08, 17:25 - Neo: What do you do in it
2020/06/08, 17:26 - Jhyan: Yeah it's got an anime art style
2020/06/08, 17:26 - Jhyan: Idk I'm playing the demo
2020/06/08, 17:26 - Jhyan: It reminds me of Tokyo Ghoul
2020/06/08, 17:26 - Jhyan: Basically you get weapons and fight enemies
2020/06/08, 17:26 - Neo: Yeah I thought it looked like sao
2020/06/08, 17:27 - Jhyan: But like they're hard and it's like Let it Die
2020/06/08, 17:27 - Jhyan: I can't explain
2020/06/08, 17:27 - Neo: Hold up why was LID bas
2020/06/08, 17:27 - Neo: Bad
2020/06/08, 17:27 - Jhyan: I would say it's like Dark Souls but that has connotations
2020/06/08, 17:28 - Jhyan: The fighting is kinda like Dark Souls but it's also not
2020/06/08, 17:28 - Jhyan: It's a lot more dynamic or responsive
2020/06/08, 17:28 - Neo: And that comparison has been used so much it's honestly lost its value
2020/06/08, 17:28 - Jhyan: In Dark Souls you have to commit to each attack
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: ?
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Jhyan: But also it's important to note that it's made by Bandai Namco and they made Dark Souls
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: That is every game no?
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Jhyan: I hated the combat in that
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: Besides For Honor
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: It wasn't great
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: But it wasnt complex
2020/06/08, 17:29 - Neo: Easy to get used to
2020/06/08, 17:30 - Jhyan: No like if you do an action you're bound to carry out the action no matter what, even if it kills you
2020/06/08, 17:30 - Jhyan: And the actions are slow
2020/06/08, 17:30 - Jhyan: And the way you move and stuff
2020/06/08, 17:30 - Neo: You're not supposed to attack if you know you can get punished
2020/06/08, 17:31 - Jhyan: But with Code Vein you can constantly dodge around enemies and run and your attacks are way faster and almost instantly start and stuff
2020/06/08, 17:31 - Jhyan: But you are
2020/06/08, 17:31 - Neo: You're supposed to attack when there are openings
2020/06/08, 17:32 - Neo: Unless you know you can trade or tank
2020/06/08, 17:32 - Jhyan: Yeah but the openings are while they're attacking
2020/06/08, 17:32 - Neo: Exactly
2020/06/08, 17:32 - Neo: You time it
2020/06/08, 17:33 - Jhyan: Ok but just look at a video of the combat and you'll see
2020/06/08, 17:33 - Neo: Later
2020/06/08, 17:34 - Neo: For me LID had really good music and a nice art style, that alone just made me want to continue playing
2020/06/08, 17:34 - Jhyan: I didn't like the art style
2020/06/08, 17:34 - Jhyan: But also Code Vein has a good art style
2020/06/08, 17:35 - Neo: Looks fine
2020/06/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: I meant music
2020/06/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: The art style isn't necessarily unique
2020/06/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: The music is good
2020/06/08, 17:35 - Jhyan: At least from what I've heard in the demo
2020/06/08, 17:36 - Neo: Let It Die had this 'realistic' gritty art style with likeable characters
2020/06/08, 17:36 - Neo: Did you get to the boss fight
2020/06/08, 17:36 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/08, 17:36 - Neo: The intros were wonderful
2020/06/08, 17:37 - Neo: And outros
2020/06/08, 17:38 - Neo: It was something new
2020/06/08, 17:38 - Neo: I have to see Code Vein but I haven't seen anything like Let It Die
2020/06/08, 17:40 - Jhyan: Idk it just reminded me of lid
2020/06/08, 17:40 - Neo: Bro you barely experienced let it die
2020/06/08, 17:40 - Neo: Such a shame
2020/06/08, 19:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/08, 19:56 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/08, 19:56 - Jhyan: Damn I kinda feel bad
2020/06/08, 19:58 - Jhyan: I'm still laughing
2020/06/08, 20:27 - Neo: Eat a mushhroms and go invisible
2020/06/08, 20:52 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/08, 21:23 - Neo: That's a tomatoes
2020/06/08, 21:24 - Jhyan: Italy
2020/06/08, 21:24 - Jhyan: He's doing the stereotypical Italian hand style
2020/06/08, 21:24 - Jhyan: And he's a tomato
2020/06/08, 21:25 - Neo: Jhyan did you ever have a cringey amv phase
2020/06/08, 21:25 - Jhyan: What's amv
2020/06/08, 21:25 - Neo: Anime music video
2020/06/08, 21:26 - Neo: https://youtu.be/qztch6_Uhuk
2020/06/08, 21:26 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/08, 21:26 - Neo: Omfg Giume and I used to watch these

2020/06/08, 21:27 - Neo: Fuck
2020/06/08, 21:27 - Jhyan: Damn not me tho
2020/06/08, 21:27 - Jhyan: I miss watching Tokyo Ghoul s1
2020/06/08, 21:27 - Jhyan: That shit was finger lickin'good
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Neo: Was it
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Neo: I barely remember it
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Jhyan: Yeah and then they fucked it uo
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Jhyan: Actually S2 was also good I think
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Neo: How
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Jhyan: I don't remember where they messed it uo
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Neo: Uo
2020/06/08, 21:28 - Jhyan: uh
2020/06/08, 21:29 - Jhyan: It lost all of its shock factor I guess
2020/06/08, 21:29 - Neo: Oh
2020/06/08, 21:29 - Jhyan: Fans of the manga hated it from the beginning though
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Jhyan: I didn't care because it was still a good anime, despite it probably not being a good adaptation
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Jhyan: But then they messed up the anime as well
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Neo: How do you get shock from a desensitized generation
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Jhyan: Bruh
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Jhyan: That's not what I meant
2020/06/08, 21:30 - Jhyan: It wasn't actually shocking but it was much more gritty
2020/06/08, 21:31 - Jhyan: Idk how to explain it
2020/06/08, 21:31 - Neo: Yeah? That's not really new groune
2020/06/08, 21:31 - Neo: Esp for anime
2020/06/08, 21:31 - Jhyan: You haven't watched it
2020/06/08, 21:31 - Neo: Yeah I have
2020/06/08, 21:32 - Neo: I just dont remember it
2020/06/08, 21:32 - Neo: Which! Should be an argument in itself
2020/06/08, 21:32 - Jhyan: Idk how to explain ir
2020/06/08, 21:32 - Jhyan: It was dark but not in the usual way
2020/06/08, 21:33 - Neo: Maybe we just have different standards
2020/06/08, 21:33 - Neo: Or definitions of dark
2020/06/08, 21:33 - Neo: Definition is a better word
2020/06/08, 21:33 - Jhyan: They were able to create a unique ambience that was unique to the anime
2020/06/08, 21:33 - Jhyan: Code Vein reminds me of that ambience
2020/06/08, 21:34 - Jhyan: Is it ambience or ambiance
2020/06/08, 21:34 - Neo: Ambulance
2020/06/08, 21:34 - Neo: Weewwoooweeewooo

2020/06/09, 18:04 - Neo: What...
2020/06/09, 18:04 - Jhyan: They made our school online but now they're giving us extra work
2020/06/09, 18:04 - Neo: Why do it
2020/06/09, 18:05 - Jhyan: Because it's school
2020/06/09, 18:05 - Jhyan: A lot of people aren't though
2020/06/09, 18:05 - Neo: No but if you know its extra and you dont have to
2020/06/09, 18:05 - Jhyan: So many people are getting behind
2020/06/09, 18:06 - Jhyan: It's not more advanced than the syllabus, it's just huge volumes of work
2020/06/09, 18:07 - Neo: Exactly
2020/06/09, 18:07 - Neo: Just do what you have to
2020/06/09, 18:07 - Jhyan: Like they give us a 3 page Google docs and ask us to fill it out based on a super long chapter of the textbook
2020/06/09, 18:07 - Jhyan: And it has a due date
2020/06/09, 18:07 - Jhyan: And we don't know if it's for marks or not
2020/06/09, 18:08 - Neo: That doesnt seme difficile
2020/06/09, 18:08 - Neo: Seem difficult
2020/06/09, 18:08 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/06/09, 18:09 - Jhyan: Well students all over the world would disagree with you
2020/06/09, 18:09 - Neo: Alright just work we can talk later
2020/06/09, 18:09 - Jhyan: I'm not actually working rn I'm in a car
2020/06/09, 18:10 - Neo: Haha oo
2020/06/09, 18:10 - Neo: Ok
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Neo: Do you recognise Dan Harmon
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Neo: And the Russo brothers
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Jhyan: They sound familiar
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Jhyan: Oh they did Infinity War
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Neo: Rick and Morty
2020/06/09, 18:11 - Jhyan: Didn't they
2020/06/09, 18:12 - Neo: Avengers
2020/06/09, 18:12 - Neo: Yeah
2020/06/09, 18:12 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/09, 18:12 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/06/09, 18:12 - Jhyan: Justin Roiland always takes the fame
2020/06/09, 18:13 - Neo: In community they do a sort of parody of bigger films like mafia movies or the purge except it's much better
2020/06/09, 18:13 - Neo: I still recognised his name
2020/06/09, 18:13 - Neo: So I guess it's something
2020/06/09, 18:14 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/09, 18:14 - Jhyan: I have to read an Afrikaans book in 2 weeks
2020/06/09, 18:14 - Jhyan: That's the worst one
2020/06/09, 18:14 - Neo: Sheesh
2020/06/09, 18:14 - Jhyan: We have to do the oral on it
2020/06/09, 18:15 - Neo: I did mine already
2020/06/09, 18:15 - Jhyan: We have to read an extract and then answer questions about what we read in the extract relating to the events of the entire book
2020/06/09, 18:15 - Jhyan: And it's not even a prescribed book
2020/06/09, 18:16 - Neo: Prescribed?
2020/06/09, 18:16 - Neo: So any afrikaans book
2020/06/09, 18:16 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/09, 18:16 - Jhyan: We have to choose it
2020/06/09, 18:16 - Jhyan: I haven't found one yet
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Jhyan: Under 300 pages
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Neo: Doesnt that make it better
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Neo: Tf
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Neo: Get a book that's been translated
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Jhyan: And it can't be a short story collection and it has to have language difficult enough for grade 11, whatever that means
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Neo: Diary of a wimpy kid lol
2020/06/09, 18:17 - Neo: Oh fuck nvm
2020/06/09, 18:18 - Jhyan: Unless it was published in Afrikaans I doubt it
2020/06/09, 18:18 - Neo: Well I guess you could argue that all gr 11s are different and my reading level is this children's book
2020/06/09, 18:18 - Neo: Since I dont speak the language
2020/06/09, 18:21 - Jhyan: And we also have to read the one that's prescribed
2020/06/09, 18:21 - Jhyan: Forgot about that
2020/06/09, 18:21 - Jhyan: But at least it's not specifically in 2 weeks
2020/06/09, 18:21 - Neo: Yeah well good luck
2020/06/10, 08:24 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/13, 11:19 - Neo: What's your favourite minecraft music disc
2020/06/13, 13:17 - Jhyan: Um
2020/06/13, 13:17 - Jhyan: The Nether music
2020/06/13, 13:18 - Jhyan: No idk
2020/06/13, 13:18 - Neo: The disc from the nether is kakamerda
2020/06/13, 13:18 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/06/13, 13:18 - Jhyan: You mean the ingame ones
2020/06/13, 13:18 - Jhyan: I do have a favourite
2020/06/13, 13:21 - Jhyan: Chirp
2020/06/13, 13:22 - Neo: Mine is stal
2020/06/13, 13:22 - Jhyan: Damn mine was between stal and chirp
2020/06/13, 13:23 - Jhyan: They're very close
2020/06/13, 13:23 - Jhyan: I almost chose stal
2020/06/13, 13:25 - Jhyan: Actually after listening to stal again I'm changing it back to stal
2020/06/13, 13:26 - Neo: Yeah my top 3 are 
Stal
Mellohi
Wait
2020/06/13, 13:28 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/06/13, 13:28 - Jhyan: I don't have a third
2020/06/13, 13:28 - Neo: Pigstep might be the worst
2020/06/14, 23:26 - Jhyan: https://twitter.com/StrangestMp4/status/1272218918325641216?s=19
2020/06/15, 08:30 - Neo: Oh yeah that's jack stauber
2020/06/15, 08:30 - Neo: He hasn't made anything in so long
2020/06/16, 22:25 - Jhyan: https://twitter.com/ThePinkBoii/status/1272586802772226049?s=09
2020/06/17, 06:08 - Neo: Lmao
2020/06/18, 20:26 - Jhyan: https://share.icloud.com/photos/0F5mSrwoncQO1HOTg9Sz6JN4g
2020/06/18, 21:54 - Neo: What is it
2020/06/18, 21:54 - Neo: Took too long to load
2020/06/18, 21:54 - Jhyan: An old video from my iPad
2020/06/18, 21:55 - Jhyan: What's wrong with your WiFi
2020/06/18, 22:17 - Neo: I'm on the other side of the house
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Neo: Omfg
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Neo: Idk who that kid is
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Jhyan: Did it load
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Jhyan: Who
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Neo: I dont own him
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Jhyan: Who
2020/06/18, 22:18 - Neo: The boy filming
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Neo: Remain unknown
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Jhyan: Must've been Giume
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Neo: No it was me lol
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Jhyan: No I know
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Neo: Oh
2020/06/18, 22:19 - Jhyan: I was playing along with the joke
2020/06/18, 22:20 - Neo: Wow John played Ana 🤢
2020/06/18, 22:21 - Jhyan: I also have a video of him failing at COD with a controller
2020/06/18, 22:21 - Neo: Yeesh
2020/06/18, 22:22 - Jhyan: He also denounced his identity when I showed it to him
2020/06/18, 22:24 - Neo: Yeah I was saying the n word though
2020/06/18, 22:24 - Neo: With a hard r
2020/06/18, 22:25 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/18, 23:29 - Neo: Jhyan can't you make your own wojaks
2020/06/18, 23:30 - Jhyan: I guess
2020/06/18, 23:30 - Jhyan: Why
2020/06/18, 23:31 - Neo: Because that's unlimited power
2020/06/18, 23:31 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/18, 23:31 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/18, 23:31 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/18, 23:31 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/18, 23:32 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/18, 23:32 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/18, 23:32 - Jhyan: But I've never really needed to
2020/06/18, 23:35 - Neo: Do you need to do anything?
2020/06/18, 23:39 - Jhyan: ?
2020/06/18, 23:40 - Neo: Does anything matter
2020/06/18, 23:40 - Neo: Why care
2020/06/18, 23:41 - Neo: Why bother
2020/06/18, 23:41 - Jhyan: I'm not about to explain philosophical concepts
2020/06/18, 23:43 - Neo: Exactly
2020/06/18, 23:43 - Neo: Because why bother
2020/06/18, 23:43 - Neo: None of it matters
2020/06/18, 23:43 - Jhyan: No because I need to sleep
2020/06/18, 23:44 - Jhyan: Or not think rn
2020/06/18, 23:44 - Neo: Exactly
2020/06/25, 23:33 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/26, 07:22 - Neo: 😔
2020/06/26, 20:26 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/06/26, 20:27 - Neo: Too smooth
2020/06/26, 20:28 - Jhyan: Did you play it with sound
2020/06/26, 20:28 - Neo: Seems fake 🤔
2020/06/26, 20:28 - Neo: Yeah lol
2020/06/26, 21:17 - Neo: Jhyan is there a game you thoroughly enjoy
2020/06/26, 21:17 - Neo: And keep coming back to
2020/06/26, 21:20 - Jhyan: Minecraft
2020/06/26, 22:03 - Neo: Is there something you despise about the company or devs
2020/06/26, 22:04 - Neo: Or like a fault in the game that they have no intention of clearing
2020/06/26, 22:04 - Neo: Fixing is a better word
2020/06/26, 22:05 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: Also Dark Souls III
2020/06/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: But idk about this one
2020/06/26, 22:06 - Jhyan: It's not the same as Minecraft
2020/06/26, 22:06 - Neo: Really?
2020/06/26, 22:07 - Neo: I think mojang can push more updates if they wanted
2020/06/26, 22:07 - Neo: It's a big update a year. C'mon
2020/06/26, 22:07 - Jhyan: Yeah but that's not a problem
2020/06/26, 22:07 - Neo: And the console update that rolled out looks a lot like a downgrade
2020/06/26, 22:08 - Neo: Yes it is...?
2020/06/26, 22:08 - Neo: That they take way too long for updates
2020/06/26, 22:08 - Neo: The game gets so stale so quickly
2020/06/26, 22:08 - Jhyan: Yeah but they could leave it right now and it would be fine
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Jhyan: Updates are already them doing better than they could
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Neo: No wayyys
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Jhyan: You're not paying a subscription for the game so why should they keep spending on it
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Neo: No but to be fair MC PC > MC console
2020/06/26, 22:09 - Neo: What?
2020/06/26, 22:10 - Neo: That has to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard
2020/06/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: Games that keep adding content updates are not the standard
2020/06/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: Why
2020/06/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: Think about your understanding
2020/06/26, 22:10 - Jhyan: You're expecting stuff from them in return for nothing
2020/06/26, 22:11 - Neo: I payed for the game
2020/06/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: I know they will survive and whatever and it also brings in new sales, but the fact is that they could stop and there would be nothing morally/ethically wrong with that
2020/06/26, 22:11 - Neo: I would pay for cosmetics
2020/06/26, 22:11 - Neo: I've bought the game 3 times
2020/06/26, 22:11 - Jhyan: Oh yeah console has cosmetics
2020/06/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: Yeah I know but the game is already good enough that you bought it 3 times
2020/06/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: With how they do things
2020/06/26, 22:12 - Neo: Was good enough
2020/06/26, 22:12 - Neo: If I knew it would be like this
2020/06/26, 22:12 - Jhyan: If they didn't update it you would've at least bought it once
2020/06/26, 22:13 - Neo: I would have never purchased it on ps4
2020/06/26, 22:13 - Neo: Yeah maybe?
2020/06/26, 22:13 - Neo: No actually
2020/06/26, 22:13 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/06/26, 22:13 - Jhyan: You wouldn't know of a timeline where they did update it so it would just be another good game
2020/06/26, 22:14 - Neo: Yeah but even then I would eventually get bored
2020/06/26, 22:15 - Neo: It takes 20 hours max to finish the game without exploits
2020/06/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: And there's literally thousands to hundreds of thousands of mods for the game
2020/06/26, 22:15 - Jhyan: On PC
2020/06/26, 22:19 - Jhyan: Ok I can get that the game isn't good for console
2020/06/26, 22:20 - Jhyan: But I really don't care about console so I don't really see it as a problem
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Jhyan: This was a PC game ported to console
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: Exactly
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: I will buy minecraft for a fourth time
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: Because I know the game is MUCH better on PC
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: The console version is horrible
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: And they dont push updates enough, but mods will supplement for that
2020/06/26, 22:21 - Neo: Debatable
2020/06/26, 22:24 - Jhyan: Wdym debatable
2020/06/26, 22:24 - Jhyan: It was literally written in code that was impossible to run on console without porting
2020/06/26, 22:25 - Jhyan: That's why there was a fixed world size last ten
2020/06/26, 22:25 - Jhyan: *gen
2020/06/26, 22:27 - Jhyan: I have a Minecraft server
2020/06/26, 22:27 - Jhyan: You could play multiplayer with me with mods even
2020/06/26, 22:28 - Jhyan: Or other people on PC
2020/06/26, 22:28 - Neo: You dont understand
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Neo: Console version is shit
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Neo: The game has been out for so long
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Jhyan: Yeah I didn't say it was a good port
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Jhyan: That was my point
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Jhyan: The console version was an afterthought
2020/06/26, 22:29 - Neo: Okay but the game has been updated and such
2020/06/26, 22:30 - Jhyan: Like Dark Souls only has Xbox controller button prompts because it was ported to PC
2020/06/26, 22:31 - Neo: That game has sequels
2020/06/26, 22:31 - Jhyan: And so
2020/06/26, 22:32 - Neo: So why would you update a game that already has sequels
2020/06/26, 22:32 - Jhyan: Dark Souls III also only has Xbox controller button prompts
2020/06/26, 22:33 - Neo: When you plug in a controller or even when you use M&KB
2020/06/26, 22:33 - Jhyan: Keyboard prompts don't exist
2020/06/26, 22:33 - Jhyan: I used to not have a controller
2020/06/26, 22:35 - Neo: Oh yeah I just checked
2020/06/26, 22:35 - Neo: You know someone refunded the game because of that
2020/06/26, 22:35 - Neo: Dumdumb
2020/06/26, 22:35 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/06/26, 22:36 - Neo: Yeah besides that isnt that big of a deal
2020/06/26, 22:36 - Jhyan: I know but I'm just demonstrating my point that ports are often not the main focus
2020/06/26, 22:37 - Jhyan: Uno
2020/06/26, 22:37 - Neo: Ok but MC has gone through countless updates changing that mindset
2020/06/26, 22:37 - Jhyan: The card game in real life, miss me with that Ubisoft shit
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Neo: The electronic version is owned by ubisoft???
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Neo: Fuck off
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Neo: Dude ubisoft is the worstt
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Jhyan: No EA is worse
2020/06/26, 22:38 - Jhyan: But Ubisoft is second best villainous game company
2020/06/26, 22:39 - Neo: It's such an honest shame because they release such fun and unique games
2020/06/26, 22:39 - Jhyan: Gimme some examples
2020/06/26, 22:39 - Jhyan: I can't remember
2020/06/26, 22:40 - Neo: Siege is very fun
For Honor, literally nothing like it 
Theres this other game they are about to release I cant remember what it was called though
2020/06/26, 22:40 - Neo: With rollerskates
2020/06/26, 22:40 - Neo: And basketball
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Neo: It looks like a rocket league rip off tbh
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Jhyan: Instead of cars playing soccer
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Jhyan: It's rollerskates playing basketball
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Neo: The division looked pretty fun
2020/06/26, 22:41 - Neo: And assassins creed
2020/06/26, 22:42 - Neo: I think so I'll check out the project again soon
2020/06/26, 22:48 - Neo: EA is already known for being a shit show and everyone expects that
2020/06/26, 22:48 - Neo: But ubisoft???
2020/06/26, 22:49 - Neo: So many people have yet to realise that those guys are capitalist pigs
2020/06/26, 22:50 - Jhyan: I guess
2020/06/26, 22:50 - Jhyan: But they still do less bad stuff
2020/06/26, 22:52 - Neo: Yeah to you
2020/06/26, 22:52 - Neo: Because you dont play any of their games
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Jhyan: I pirated far cry 5
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Neo: Lettss  goooo
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Jhyan: And I tried to play Uno on mobile
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Neo: There we go
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Jhyan: And didn't buy Uno on PC
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Neo: I am going to pirate their games
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Jhyan: Actually isn't there a free version on PC too
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Neo: Idk
2020/06/26, 22:53 - Jhyan: Anyway you have to pay to play multiplayer so
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Neo: How do you play the free version
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Neo: Without friends
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Jhyan: There's bots
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Jhyan: It's more of a demo
2020/06/26, 22:54 - Neo: Oh
2020/06/28, 20:32 - Jhyan: What was that game you told me about
2020/06/28, 20:37 - Neo: Grounded?
2020/06/28, 20:39 - Neo: Idk
2020/06/28, 20:40 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/28, 20:40 - Jhyan: It had like demons and stuff
2020/06/28, 20:40 - Jhyan: Idk that type of thing
2020/06/28, 20:41 - Neo: I dunno
2020/06/28, 20:41 - Neo: Demon's Soul
2020/06/28, 20:41 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/28, 20:41 - Neo: Or something like that
2020/06/28, 20:43 - Neo: Now I want to know what you're talking about
2020/06/28, 20:44 - Neo: What is the game called
2020/06/28, 20:46 - Jhyan: I think it had something to do with a mirror
2020/06/28, 20:46 - Jhyan: You fight these enemies
2020/06/28, 20:47 - Jhyan: One of the environments was pretty grey
2020/06/28, 20:47 - Jhyan: Lmao
2020/06/28, 20:48 - Jhyan: Dude
2020/06/28, 20:49 - Neo: No idk
2020/06/28, 20:49 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/28, 20:49 - Jhyan: Come on
2020/06/28, 20:53 - Neo: Is that all
2020/06/28, 20:53 - Neo: Idk
2020/06/28, 20:54 - Jhyan: I found it
2020/06/28, 20:54 - Jhyan: Mortal Shell
2020/06/28, 20:56 - Jhyan: What do you think about The Last of Us 2
2020/06/28, 20:56 - Jhyan: And also Cyberpunk 2077
2020/06/28, 20:57 - Neo: Cyberpunks gameplay looks horrible
2020/06/28, 20:57 - Neo: And TLOU doesnt seem that bad
2020/06/28, 20:57 - Jhyan: Where have you seen this
2020/06/28, 20:58 - Neo: As bad as people make it
2020/06/28, 20:58 - Jhyan: I only saw gameplay at E3 last year
2020/06/28, 20:58 - Jhyan: Yeah I thought it was extremely good from watching a playthrough
2020/06/28, 20:58 - Jhyan: People need to shut up
2020/06/28, 20:58 - Jhyan: Social media is blowing responses out of proportion
2020/06/28, 20:59 - Jhyan: Everyone wants to fit in so complaints become a feedback loop
2020/06/28, 20:59 - Neo: I'm not sure when or where it was from but it looked like you were trying to steal a car but then another hijacker steals it from you then you get interrupted by the police
2020/06/28, 20:59 - Neo: Who are now working with some rich guy
2020/06/28, 20:59 - Neo: Yeah that's what this other guy was saying
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Jhyan: The same thing happened with GoT
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Jhyan: That ending was good imo
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Neo: https://youtu.be/Mt1BtM0MJrA
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Neo: This
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Neo: I only watched half of it
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Neo: Never interested me enough tbh
2020/06/28, 21:00 - Jhyan: Like normally people would just say they don't like it and then that's the end of it
2020/06/28, 21:01 - Jhyan: And when enough isolated events of people doing this happen, you know it's bad
2020/06/28, 21:01 - Neo: The voice acting sucks, combat sucks and graphics are mediocre
2020/06/28, 21:01 - Neo: Yeah?
2020/06/28, 21:01 - Jhyan: I'm watching gameplay from 4 hours ago rn
2020/06/28, 21:02 - Neo: At 4 mins
2020/06/28, 21:02 - Neo: Try watch the video i sent at the 4:00 time stamp
2020/06/28, 21:02 - Neo: That's what made me raise an eyebrow
2020/06/28, 21:03 - Jhyan: Dude this fucking video is just nonstop cutscenes
2020/06/28, 21:03 - Neo: The one I sent
2020/06/28, 21:03 - Neo: Na there is gameplay
2020/06/28, 21:03 - Neo: Is there not
2020/06/28, 21:04 - Jhyan: I'll watch the one you sent
2020/06/28, 21:04 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/06/28, 21:05 - Neo: You can watch the first 4 mins but it's just cliche writing and voice actors with weird pauses
2020/06/28, 21:05 - Jhyan: You really have a thing for voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:06 - Jhyan: Soon you'll be calling someone out for bad voice acting when they pause
2020/06/28, 21:07 - Jhyan: What's wrong with the 4:00 timestamp
2020/06/28, 21:07 - Jhyan: Are you talking about the fistfight
2020/06/28, 21:08 - Jhyan: Because it doesn't look good, but it's not a melee fighting game
2020/06/28, 21:08 - Neo: Have you seen it??
2020/06/28, 21:09 - Neo: I know it doesnt look good
2020/06/28, 21:09 - Neo: It looks like shit
2020/06/28, 21:09 - Neo: And sounds like Dues Ex
2020/06/28, 21:09 - Jhyan: Ok but it's still that it's an fps not a melee game
2020/06/28, 21:09 - Jhyan: I think they shouldn't have put that in the game
2020/06/28, 21:10 - Jhyan: I've seen something like that before and it wasn't fun
2020/06/28, 21:12 - Jhyan: Wait gimme an example of good voice acting in a range
2020/06/28, 21:12 - Jhyan: *game
2020/06/28, 21:12 - Neo: Ok but why put something that isnt your strong point in the demo
2020/06/28, 21:12 - Jhyan: Because the quality in Cyberpunk seems standard to me
2020/06/28, 21:12 - Jhyan: Not good
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Neo: Uh
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Jhyan: Just standard
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Neo: The voice acting in cyberpunk sounds fine to you?
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Neo: Overwatch actually
2020/06/28, 21:13 - Jhyan: But the standard of voice acting is bad
2020/06/28, 21:14 - Jhyan: Invalid, you can't see them talking, it's just interjections in that
2020/06/28, 21:14 - Jhyan: Which are not only gonna inherently be easier to implement, they can also be perfected as there's no animation to go with them
2020/06/28, 21:14 - Neo: What do you mean
2020/06/28, 21:15 - Neo: No but it's still good voice acting...?
2020/06/28, 21:15 - Jhyan: You can literally just go to a studio and keep recording until it's good quality
2020/06/28, 21:15 - Jhyan: And only focus on the audio
2020/06/28, 21:15 - Jhyan: Still invalid because you can't compare it
2020/06/28, 21:16 - Jhyan: If they had really shitty character animation you might say it was bad voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:16 - Jhyan: They work hand in hand
2020/06/28, 21:16 - Jhyan: And they're not conversations either, they're one-liners
2020/06/28, 21:16 - Jhyan: Do you get what I'm saying
2020/06/28, 21:17 - Jhyan: I'm saying it's the standard of the game industry
2020/06/28, 21:17 - Neo: No the characters do 'interact'
2020/06/28, 21:18 - Neo: No but I'm judging by voice alone
2020/06/28, 21:18 - Jhyan: You can't be, you've already seen the animation that goes with them
2020/06/28, 21:18 - Neo: And converse to an extent
2020/06/28, 21:18 - Jhyan: If the character had bad animation it'll already factor into your opinion
2020/06/28, 21:18 - Neo: No it isnt
2020/06/28, 21:19 - Jhyan: You can't just make it untrue by saying it
2020/06/28, 21:20 - Jhyan: Compare it to a similar type of game
2020/06/28, 21:20 - Jhyan: Like Fallout 4 or something
2020/06/28, 21:20 - Jhyan: Maybe not that
2020/06/28, 21:23 - Jhyan: What about Rage 2
2020/06/28, 21:23 - Jhyan: That was also an open world FPS in the same style
2020/06/28, 21:23 - Neo: Never played it
2020/06/28, 21:23 - Jhyan: And more recent
2020/06/28, 21:23 - Jhyan: Ok just search for a cutscene or something
2020/06/28, 21:24 - Neo: Well the graphics for Cyberpunk are not helping its case
2020/06/28, 21:24 - Neo: Overwatch has some okay graphics
2020/06/28, 21:25 - Jhyan: I also don't see a problem, but even if I did, they're upgrading it with RTX apparently
2020/06/28, 21:25 - Jhyan: Actually some of the textures were low res
2020/06/28, 21:26 - Neo: Yeah it still looked pretty good to me
2020/06/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: ?
2020/06/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: Then why are you trash talking it
2020/06/28, 21:27 - Neo: The voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:27 - Jhyan: But the graphics
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Neo: Oh no that scene with those guys fighting looks super low effort
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Neo: Did I say graphics
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Neo: It was by accident probably
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Jhyan: Here
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Jhyan: And here
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Neo: Yeah I was talking about that scene specifically
2020/06/28, 21:28 - Jhyan: Oh ok yeah
2020/06/28, 21:29 - Jhyan: The one with the fistfight or where he gets pulled out the car
2020/06/28, 21:29 - Neo: As in the good visuals are not helping the case of bad voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:29 - Neo: No that scene looked fine
2020/06/28, 21:30 - Jhyan: Dude the voice acting is normal
2020/06/28, 21:31 - Neo: Below average at best
2020/06/28, 21:32 - Jhyan: I've only seen better voice acting in like TLoU2, Tomb Raider, Quantum Break, Hitman 1 and 2, idk
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Neo: O uncharted
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Jhyan: Yeah uncharted 4
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Neo: That's a good one
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Neo: Infamous...?
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Neo: Maybe that was too long ago
2020/06/28, 21:33 - Neo: Cant say
2020/06/28, 21:34 - Jhyan: Nah that wasn't better enough that I'd classify it as better
2020/06/28, 21:34 - Jhyan: I'm only mentioning ones that break standard
2020/06/28, 21:34 - Jhyan: Like there totally different
2020/06/28, 21:34 - Jhyan: *they're
2020/06/28, 21:34 - Neo: Doesnt matter
2020/06/28, 21:36 - Jhyan: The Fallen Order
2020/06/28, 21:36 - Neo: Oblivion
2020/06/28, 21:36 - Jhyan: Yeah this had some really good dialogue
2020/06/28, 21:37 - Jhyan: Oh yeah this was the best of all time
2020/06/28, 21:37 - Jhyan: Nobody forgets the classic: "Stop! You have violated the law!"
2020/06/28, 21:40 - Neo: "Hold on let me redo this line"
2020/06/28, 21:40 - Neo: That's the best one
2020/06/28, 21:40 - Jhyan: Is that an actual thing
2020/06/28, 21:41 - Neo: Yeah let me look for the vid
2020/06/28, 21:41 - Neo: I cant say but from what I've seen Arkam Knight did a pretty good job
2020/06/28, 21:42 - Neo: https://youtu.be/L9REWMEOLdI
2020/06/28, 21:43 - Neo: "Wait a minute let me do that one again"
2020/06/28, 21:43 - Jhyan: But I'm considering the variety, animation, quality, and the fit of the voice lines.
2020/06/28, 21:43 - Jhyan: And maybe other things that I can't think of or put a name to rn
2020/06/28, 21:43 - Neo: I'm judging by voice lines alone
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Neo: Voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Jhyan: There's your problem
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Neo: How
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Neo: Why
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Jhyan: Games without the other stuff are at a disadvantage because it's impossible for you to judge it alone
2020/06/28, 21:44 - Jhyan: If you would do a scientific test on this the participants would just be played the audio
2020/06/28, 21:45 - Jhyan: But you have the character animation, the quantity of lines, the relation to the game, even the quality of the game itself like the graphics that form positive connections with that game
2020/06/28, 21:46 - Jhyan: And I do too, but I am trying to consider those factors
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Neo: What
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Neo: It makes it more fair
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: Like how do you even consider the quality of the line itself
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: Are you just saying sound quality?
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Neo: No
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: Or like how realistic it is?
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: How do you judge this without knowing the context
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Neo: Yeah
2020/06/28, 21:47 - Jhyan: You're judging it against context
2020/06/28, 21:48 - Jhyan: That proves it's biased
2020/06/28, 21:48 - Jhyan: There's no argument there
2020/06/28, 21:48 - Neo: Reinhardt from OW
2020/06/28, 21:48 - Neo: That is a good voice
2020/06/28, 21:49 - Neo: Recognisable, character,
2020/06/28, 21:49 - Neo: Ho
2020/06/28, 21:49 - Jhyan: You can't compare to Overwatch
2020/06/28, 21:49 - Jhyan: You could compare Overwatch to Valorant if you wanted
2020/06/28, 21:50 - Neo: What
2020/06/28, 21:50 - Neo: Because it isnt the same kind of game?
2020/06/28, 21:51 - Jhyan: Because neither have character animations or cutscenes or an overarching story that the lines relate to etc.
2020/06/28, 21:51 - Jhyan: Character animations that go with the voices I mean
2020/06/28, 21:52 - Jhyan: All they've got are audioboxes in each character that spit out audio files
2020/06/28, 21:52 - Jhyan: And because they're the same type of game, it reduces the bias factor
2020/06/28, 21:53 - Neo: That's why I judge the lines on their own
2020/06/28, 21:53 - Jhyan: But you can't
2020/06/28, 21:53 - Neo: Ok
2020/06/28, 21:54 - Jhyan: These kind of influences are subconscious
2020/06/28, 21:55 - Jhyan: It's literally impossible for you to be completely objective by yourself
2020/06/28, 21:55 - Jhyan: It's also impossible for me, but I'm judging with better criteria that eliminates more of the bias factor
2020/06/28, 21:57 - Neo: Ok
2020/06/28, 21:57 - Neo: I'm tired you win lol
2020/06/28, 21:57 - Neo: Cyberpunk has very good voice acting
2020/06/28, 21:58 - Jhyan: No
2020/06/28, 21:59 - Jhyan: We both lost
2020/06/28, 21:59 - Neo: Ok then it doesnt
2020/06/28, 21:59 - Neo: Sure
2020/06/28, 21:59 - Jhyan: I actually hate freedom of speech
2020/06/28, 21:59 - Neo: Yeah
2020/06/28, 22:00 - Jhyan: It has never turned out well in large societies
2020/06/28, 22:01 - Jhyan: Actually it was necessary before we had objective systems
2020/06/28, 22:01 - Jhyan: It's still necessary then
2020/06/28, 22:01 - Jhyan: But less so, and almost obsolete
2020/06/28, 22:02 - Neo: Lis
2020/06/28, 22:02 - Jhyan: There won't be a need for it once humans are out of power over other humans
2020/06/28, 22:02 - Neo: Listening to playboi carti
2020/06/30, 10:19 - Neo: https://youtu.be/G_1_BRV0roY
2020/06/30, 10:19 - Neo: Idk if you would like this game
2020/07/07, 20:27 - Neo: Have you seen deathloop
2020/07/07, 20:27 - Neo: Game by bethesda looks a lot like Dishonoured
2020/07/07, 20:30 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/07/07, 20:30 - Jhyan: It's made by the same people as dishonored
2020/07/07, 20:30 - Jhyan: Arkane Studios
2020/07/07, 20:30 - Jhyan: It looks interesting
2020/07/07, 20:30 - Neo: Yeah
2020/07/07, 20:31 - Neo: Not bethesda
2020/07/07, 20:31 - Neo: Or is it like a joint project
2020/07/07, 20:31 - Jhyan: They're owned by Bethesda
2020/07/07, 20:31 - Neo: Oh that makes sense
2020/07/07, 20:31 - Jhyan: Prey was also Arkane Studios/Bethesda
2020/07/07, 21:17 - Neo: Yeah I've yet to play that but I really liked how it looks
2020/07/07, 21:17 - Jhyan: It's also fun to play
2020/07/07, 21:18 - Jhyan: I finished it without having to make myself
2020/07/07, 21:18 - Neo: Oh
2020/07/07, 21:18 - Neo: As in without forcing or yourself to enjoy it
2020/07/07, 21:19 - Jhyan: No like I enjoyed it enough that I didn't have to think about needing to finish it
2020/07/07, 21:35 - Neo: Ohh
2020/07/11, 13:41 - Neo: Jhyan where did you get that kraken headset
2020/07/11, 13:41 - Jhyan: Idk but incredible connection sells it I think
2020/07/11, 13:44 - Jhyan: And maybe Musica or something
2020/07/11, 13:45 - Jhyan: Otherwise you can probably find it either on an online store or just by using the internet to find a store
2020/07/11, 14:30 - Neo: Tried online but it looks like we are going to have to order it
2020/07/11, 14:30 - Neo: Are we the same amount of white
2020/07/11, 14:33 - Jhyan: What
2020/07/11, 14:33 - Neo: You and  I are both only half white right
2020/07/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/07/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: But it depends on how you measure it
2020/07/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: If you're measuring by melanin I'm more white
2020/07/11, 14:43 - Jhyan: Because my dad was Indian
2020/07/11, 14:44 - Jhyan: But if you're measuring with gene sequences, which may or may not be an actual thing, we're the same
2020/07/11, 15:02 - Neo: Was?
2020/07/11, 15:37 - Jhyan: Is
2020/07/11, 15:37 - Neo: Oh lol
2020/07/13, 22:47 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/07/14, 07:26 - Neo: Finally
2020/07/30, 17:13 - Jhyan: Do you still use the headphones I gave you
2020/07/30, 17:14 - Jhyan: I kinda need them
2020/07/30, 17:17 - Neo: Yeah I use them but they don't work welll
2020/07/30, 17:18 - Neo: They disconnect but I will ask my dad when I can drop them off when he gets home
2020/07/30, 17:23 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/07/30, 17:26 - Jhyan: Wait do you want them
2020/07/30, 17:26 - Jhyan: Do you use them all the time
2020/07/30, 17:26 - Jhyan: Or
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: I use them whenever I play yeah
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Jhyan: Oof
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: But giume said he was supposed to get a new pair
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: But it's cool I can give them back
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: I can get my parents to get you a pair for your birthday
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Jhyan: No
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Jhyan: I have a pair
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: Rather the money for a new one
2020/07/30, 17:27 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/07/30, 17:28 - Jhyan: My other friend needs them
2020/07/30, 17:28 - Jhyan: Like can't use his PC with audio without them
2020/07/30, 17:28 - Jhyan: Unless he buys a new pair but they're expensive
2020/07/30, 17:28 - Jhyan: And he just built the PC
2020/07/30, 17:28 - Neo: Ohhh
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Jhyan: I just figured on console it's kinda optional
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Neo: Yeah I dont have audio on my ps either
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Jhyan: But if you really want them you can keep using them
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Neo: Because I bought a monitor
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Jhyan: Ohhh
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Jhyan: Is Giume actually getting new ones
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Neo: I really don't know
2020/07/30, 17:29 - Jhyan: Coz if you don't have audio without it then maybe keep them idk
2020/07/30, 17:30 - Neo: Giume is one of those people
2020/07/30, 17:30 - Jhyan: Go check if Giume is getting new ones
2020/07/30, 17:30 - Neo: On the toilet
2020/07/30, 17:30 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/07/30, 17:31 - Neo: I'll ask but hes gonna say something like ''I will''
2020/07/30, 17:31 - Neo: And if I ask when hes just gonna say ''get off my dick'
2020/07/30, 17:31 - Neo: '
2020/07/30, 17:32 - Jhyan: Well tell him he might not be able to hear the game if he doesn't
2020/07/30, 17:32 - Neo: Ye
2020/07/31, 16:00 - Jhyan: So did Giume say anything
2020/07/31, 16:19 - Jhyan: Wait does the mic work
2020/07/31, 16:57 - Neo: Yeah
2020/07/31, 16:57 - Neo: Giume said hes cool with it
2020/07/31, 16:57 - Neo: But idk if he is going to buy another one
2020/07/31, 17:21 - Jhyan: He's cool with not hearing any audio
2020/07/31, 17:21 - Jhyan: What
2020/07/31, 17:21 - Neo: Yeah
2020/07/31, 17:22 - Jhyan: Ok well if you don't mind giving it back then please do
2020/07/31, 17:23 - Neo: Yeah I just have to ask my dad when
2020/07/31, 17:23 - Jhyan: He'll probably buy another one after playing without audio for a few times
2020/07/31, 17:23 - Jhyan: Especially because he was already going to
2020/07/31, 17:23 - Neo: Yeah I know but I just dont know how soon that will be
2020/07/31, 17:23 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/07/31, 17:24 - Jhyan: Wait on a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you want to keep them
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Neo: Idk like a 7
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Neo: I really dont mind returning them
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Neo: Where did you get the headset again
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Jhyan: I don't remember
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Jhyan: I think I got it online
2020/07/31, 17:25 - Neo: Fuck
2020/07/31, 17:26 - Neo: Oh maybe that's better
2020/07/31, 17:26 - Jhyan: The online market is way better in South Africa than it used to be
2020/07/31, 17:26 - Neo: Which store did you use
2020/07/31, 17:27 - Jhyan: I think I just used Amazon
2020/07/31, 17:27 - Jhyan: But there's more options now
2020/07/31, 17:27 - Jhyan: And Amazon itself is better than it was
2020/07/31, 17:27 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/07/31, 17:27 - Neo: Thanks
2020/07/31, 17:28 - Jhyan: You can buy the Razer Kraken v2 at incredibly connection even
2020/07/31, 17:29 - Neo: Last time I checked in the physical store there wasn't anything
2020/07/31, 17:29 - Jhyan: But yeah look around for options
2020/07/31, 17:29 - Neo: But it's fine I will
2020/07/31, 17:29 - Jhyan: Check their online store, it will tell you which one has it
2020/07/31, 17:29 - Jhyan: Or even just let you order without going to a physical location
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: Remember Unspoilme
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Neo: No
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: That thing Samsung did to promote their TV
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Neo: No..
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: It was basically a guided hypnosis that was supposed to make you forget a show so you can watch it again
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: I did it
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: Long ago
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Jhyan: 2 years ago
2020/07/31, 20:48 - Neo: Ohh
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Jhyan: But I can't remember the show I did it with
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Neo: I think I remember
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Neo: Lmao
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Jhyan: Not because it worked but because I just forgot
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Neo: Oh
2020/07/31, 20:49 - Jhyan: Yeah it's so frustrating
2020/07/31, 20:52 - Neo: That's pretty funny though
2020/07/31, 20:53 - Jhyan: .
2020/07/31, 20:56 - Jhyan: And I didn't tell you what show I was testing it on
2020/07/31, 20:56 - Jhyan: Or anyone else I told about it
2020/07/31, 20:56 - Neo: I dont have that message
2020/07/31, 20:56 - Neo: No search results
2020/07/31, 20:57 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/07/31, 20:58 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/07/31, 20:58 - Neo: Maybe that's how it works
2020/07/31, 20:59 - Neo: Nothing is real and everyone is an actor
2020/07/31, 20:59 - Neo: And they give you brain damage or something
2020/07/31, 20:59 - Jhyan: What
2020/07/31, 20:59 - Jhyan: Wdym
2020/07/31, 21:00 - Neo: Samsung's hypnosis thing
2020/07/31, 21:00 - Neo: After you do it they just replace every person in your life with an actor
2020/07/31, 21:00 - Neo: Then they replace you
2020/07/31, 21:00 - Neo: And none of your actions are actually yours
2020/07/31, 21:00 - Neo: All predetermined
2020/07/31, 21:01 - Neo: I have brain damage lol
2020/07/31, 21:01 - Jhyan: Oh yeah the hypnosis just makes you go to sleep after sending your GPS location and they send agents to take you
2020/07/31, 21:01 - Jhyan: I live in a Hollywood set
2020/07/31, 21:01 - Neo: Or maybe they have an actual simulation that they put you in
2020/07/31, 21:02 - Neo: So that no one else suffers
2020/07/31, 21:02 - Neo: Onky you
2020/07/31, 21:02 - Jhyan: I'm in the matrix rn
2020/07/31, 21:12 - Neo: What's stopping you from pooping yourself while you're in there
2020/07/31, 21:13 - Jhyan: Anal tubes
2020/07/31, 21:13 - Jhyan: Or perfectly calibrated nutrient supplies
2020/07/31, 21:13 - Jhyan: So there's no waste matter
2020/07/31, 21:14 - Neo: Maybe they just sit in the poopoo
2020/07/31, 21:14 - Jhyan: Maybe
2020/07/31, 21:14 - Neo: That would be pretty cool
2020/07/31, 21:14 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/08/01, 21:28 - Neo: Yeah that's what the onion is
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Neo: Are you at your mom's house tomorrow
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: Obviously I know that
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: I see their stuff regularly
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Neo: Have you seen the one with the gorilla
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Jhyan: No
2020/08/01, 21:29 - Neo: https://youtu.be/CJkWS4t4l0k
2020/08/01, 21:30 - Jhyan: Did you see the one about schools
2020/08/01, 21:30 - Neo: No
2020/08/01, 21:30 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RrreVthWRY
2020/08/01, 21:32 - Jhyan: Ok I watched this
2020/08/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic_iClOg34A&t=7s
2020/08/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: Also this
2020/08/01, 21:34 - Jhyan: Those two are my favourite videos
2020/08/01, 21:35 - Neo: I think the gorilla is always going to be my favourite
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Jhyan: They gave him the concept of mortality
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Neo: Yeah
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Jhyan: When he started banging his head against the wall that's when I knew: we did it.
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Neo: And the panic attack part is my favourite
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Jhyan: Did you watch the radish one
2020/08/01, 21:36 - Jhyan: Same
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Neo: Yeah
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Neo: The small glass of water
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: It's so good
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Neo: Or the son dying is fucking hilarious
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: Yeah that was great
2020/08/01, 21:37 - Jhyan: Wait there was a line I'm trying to remember
2020/08/01, 21:40 - Jhyan: It's the world's only vegetable
2020/08/01, 21:41 - Jhyan: And them suddenly explaining what a radish is but having different explanations every time
2020/08/01, 21:41 - Neo: Jesus christs new Nike sneakers
2020/08/01, 21:42 - Neo: Yeah
2020/08/02, 13:15 - Neo: What was that game with the monkies
2020/08/02, 13:16 - Neo: Ancestry
2020/08/02, 13:16 - Neo: Ancestors. Did you like it
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Jhyan: But I stopped playing it
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Neo: Does it have an ending
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Jhyan: I haven't gotten around to going back
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Jhyan: Probably
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Neo: You pirated it right
2020/08/02, 13:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/02, 17:55 - Jhyan: So what's so special about this chili
2020/08/02, 17:56 - Neo: Nothing really.  Just over priced hear in ZA
2020/08/02, 17:56 - Neo: And it isnt really 5gat spicy
2020/08/02, 17:56 - Jhyan: I haven't tried it yet
2020/08/02, 17:57 - Jhyan: So this is from Italy
2020/08/02, 17:57 - Neo: Yeah lol
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Jhyan: What should I eat it with
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Jhyan: Does it work on sandwiches
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Neo: Uhh yeah. It's pretty oily
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Neo: So more a liquid than a paste
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/02, 17:58 - Neo: Goes really well with rice
2020/08/02, 17:59 - Jhyan: Just plain rice
2020/08/02, 17:59 - Jhyan: I will cook with it next time I make something
2020/08/02, 17:59 - Neo: That's what I've been eating a lot recently
2020/08/02, 17:59 - Neo: Yeah you can use it like traditional chilli
2020/08/02, 18:04 - Jhyan: I dipped my finger in it and it tastes really good
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Jhyan: Also I helped my friend decide what parts to get for his PC
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Neo: Oh that's great. I was thinking of just making my own chilli
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Jhyan: He already had a list but I looked over it and changed some things
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Jhyan: Wdym
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Neo: Fuck I wish I started saving sooner
2020/08/02, 18:05 - Neo: And giume is so stubborn
2020/08/02, 18:06 - Jhyan: Anyway I know it's way above your budget but his was R20k and it's able to run like everything
2020/08/02, 18:06 - Neo: He constantly talks about going pro but refuses to use better equipment
2020/08/02, 18:06 - Jhyan: So I'm pretty sure I can do yours
2020/08/02, 18:06 - Neo: Wow
2020/08/02, 18:06 - Jhyan: Yeah 12k should get you pretty far though
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Neo: Yeah. I just wish I started saving sooner or bought this stuff before the prices rose
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Neo: Rose
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Neo: Rhose
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Jhyan: Especially because of this
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Neo: Lol
2020/08/02, 18:07 - Jhyan: Have they risen?
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Neo: Yeah it kind of pisses me off that I paid for the monitor on my own and giume probably uses it more than me
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Jhyan: They were super bad a year or two ago because of the Bitcoin market driving up demand really high
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Neo: Well a few years ago it was definitely cheaper
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Jhyan: But you can use it when you get the rest of the stuff
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Jhyan: Maybe it's inflation
2020/08/02, 18:08 - Neo: Yeah
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Jhyan: Anyway I don't recommend Nvidia if you want to get cheaper stuff
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Neo: Have you watched 2001
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Jhyan: They're charging high prices
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Neo: How come
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Neo: Oh
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Jhyan: Oh yeah that's actually probably the reason
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Neo: 2001: A space odyssey
2020/08/02, 18:09 - Jhyan: Their GPUs are all priced highly whereas in previous generations they were each different price ranges
2020/08/02, 18:10 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/08/02, 18:10 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/08/02, 18:10 - Jhyan: Basically they're just being capitalistic
2020/08/02, 18:10 - Neo: Oh yeah. Capitalism is a pain
2020/08/02, 18:10 - Neo: Did you like it
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Neo: Oh
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Jhyan: I watched Ad Astra recently and it reminded me of 2001
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Neo: I liked the beginning a lot
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Jhyan: With the monke
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Neo: That reminded me of Ancestors
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Neo: Hmm monke
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Jhyan: Oh yeah
2020/08/02, 18:11 - Neo: Which is why I brought it up earlier
2020/08/02, 18:12 - Jhyan: Oh makes sense
2020/08/02, 18:14 - Neo: Which do you prefer, interstellar or 2001
2020/08/02, 18:15 - Jhyan: Interstellar
2020/08/02, 19:23 - Jhyan: I had some of the sauce with some chicken and it's great
2020/08/02, 19:23 - Neo: That's great
2020/08/02, 19:23 - Jhyan: In my top 4
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Jhyan: Or at least comparable to my top 4
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Neo: They do sell it around ZA but next time I go to Rome I could some more for you
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Neo: Which probably iisnt any time soon
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Jhyan: Lmao
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Jhyan: But yeah
2020/08/02, 19:24 - Jhyan: That would be pretty cash money of you
2020/08/02, 19:25 - Neo: It's like 3 or 4 euros not an inconvenience at all
2020/08/02, 19:26 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/08/06, 20:54 - Neo: Which do you think is worse ubisoft or EA
2020/08/06, 20:59 - Jhyan: EA
2020/08/06, 21:02 - Neo: How come
2020/08/06, 21:03 - Jhyan: One time they tried to state that they knew what was best for us basically
2020/08/06, 21:03 - Jhyan: 1 to 2 years ago they were trying to push this narrative of "games as a service" and saying as if it were fact: "people don't want singleplayer games anymore"
2020/08/06, 21:04 - Jhyan: Fuck you EA you can't just say something that makes you more money and expect us to conform
2020/08/06, 21:04 - Jhyan: That's just one example
2020/08/06, 21:04 - Neo: Ohh yeah
2020/08/06, 21:05 - Neo: I think they are both pretty shitty since they want to maximize profit instead of having a happy fan base
2020/08/06, 21:05 - Neo: Or at least prioritize profit
2020/08/06, 21:06 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: Well Ubisoft isn't as bad
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: They still make ok games
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: And they at least hide how bad the are
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Jhyan: And don't throw microtransactions in your face and stuff
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Neo: See that's why I think it's worse
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Neo: Because no one really knows how shitty they are
2020/08/06, 21:07 - Neo: Debatable
2020/08/07, 12:58 - Neo: https://youtu.be/RpkQEq75y18
2020/08/07, 12:58 - Jhyan: I can't watch it rn
2020/08/07, 14:52 - Neo: Watch it when you can
2020/08/20, 18:10 - Neo: https://youtu.be/AdtyvFvdzi8
2020/09/08, 14:16 - Neo: Jhyan what graphics card fo you use
2020/09/08, 14:17 - Neo: I think it might be better if I get a 1060
2020/09/08, 14:45 - Jhyan: 1070
2020/09/08, 14:45 - Jhyan: But the 30 series use came out
2020/09/08, 14:45 - Jhyan: The 20 series will be cheaper now
2020/09/08, 14:45 - Neo: Yeah well I'm not gonna buy the 30
2020/09/08, 14:46 - Jhyan: That's not what I meant
2020/09/08, 14:46 - Jhyan: ^
2020/09/08, 14:46 - Neo: Oh yeah. But what's the point. My monitor is only 1920 × 1080
2020/09/08, 14:46 - Neo: Yeah I realised lol
2020/09/08, 14:58 - Neo: So shouldn't a 1060 Ti suffice
2020/09/08, 15:09 - Jhyan: Games are getting more demanding though
2020/09/08, 15:09 - Jhyan: The resolution of your screen might stay the same, but developers are gonna put more complex geometry and textures and maths in the game
2020/09/08, 15:10 - Jhyan: It will be competent
2020/09/08, 15:10 - Jhyan: I think
2020/09/08, 15:10 - Neo: Yeah but I'm not really gonna buy newer games
2020/09/08, 15:10 - Neo: None of them really intrest me
2020/09/08, 15:10 - Jhyan: Ok then yeah
2020/09/08, 15:11 - Jhyan: Then a 1060 will be fine
2020/09/18, 22:59 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/09/18, 23:28 - Neo: Lol I have a max pointage of 200 000 in this game
2020/09/19, 13:04 - Neo: 677 000
2020/09/19, 13:04 - Jhyan: Is that your score
2020/09/19, 13:05 - Neo: Yeah
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Neo: Have you seen the demon souls remake
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Neo: It's a ps5 exclusive 😐
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Jhyan: But it's console exclusive
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Jhyan: So
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/09/20, 19:10 - Jhyan: *yeah
2020/09/20, 19:11 - Neo: You dont think there will be any ports to any other platform
2020/09/20, 19:11 - Neo: I think it might come to PC through PSNow
2020/09/20, 19:11 - Jhyan: Wtf is that
2020/09/20, 19:12 - Jhyan: I don't want some subscription service
2020/09/20, 19:12 - Jhyan: Coz that's what it sounds like
2020/09/20, 19:12 - Neo: It's a secondary PS Plus
2020/09/20, 19:12 - Neo: Yup
2020/09/20, 19:12 - Neo: Its the only way to play the original infamous games on ps4
2020/09/20, 19:14 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/09/20, 19:14 - Jhyan: That sucks
2020/09/20, 19:14 - Neo: There is that free trial lol
2020/09/20, 19:14 - Neo: Giume said he is gonna buy a ps5 so I'm not too stressed about it
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: But they'll make you put in a credit card
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: So you can only do it one
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: And it will be like a week long
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Neo: There are credit card generator sites
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: There's no way I'm finishing Demon's Souls in a week
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Jhyan: They don't work
2020/09/20, 19:40 - Neo: If you have a full week of doing nothing
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Neo: I think I could lol
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Jhyan: Nah I'll get bored of just playing the same game
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Neo: For real??
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Neo: How do you know
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Jhyan: When evaluated they don't do anything
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Jhyan: Because I've tried
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Jhyan: They say it's invalid
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Neo: :(
2020/09/20, 19:41 - Neo: Get a stranger's card
2020/09/20, 19:42 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/21, 12:56 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/09/21, 12:56 - Neo: She kinda looks like you
2020/09/21, 12:57 - Jhyan: No
2020/09/21, 12:57 - Neo: Not even a little?
2020/09/21, 12:57 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/09/21, 12:57 - Jhyan: I'll go look at it
2020/09/21, 12:58 - Neo: What?
2020/09/21, 13:00 - Jhyan: Ok
2020/09/21, 13:01 - Jhyan: Fine
2020/09/21, 13:01 - Jhyan: You're right
2020/09/21, 13:01 - Neo: I guess it looks a little like your sister
2020/09/21, 13:01 - Neo: More than you
2020/09/21, 13:02 - Jhyan: Yeah idk
2020/09/23, 08:12 - Neo: Jhyan what case do you use
2020/09/23, 08:28 - Jhyan: Uh
2020/09/23, 08:28 - Jhyan: CM Storm Trooper
2020/09/23, 08:38 - Neo: Do you think its good
2020/09/23, 08:38 - Neo: Lol maybe we shouldn't have the same chassis
2020/09/23, 08:38 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/09/23, 08:39 - Jhyan: It's good for ventilation
2020/09/23, 08:39 - Neo: Yeah that's literally the only guideline I have for the case
2020/09/23, 08:50 - Neo: What about the Power Supply. Do you think it matters
2020/09/23, 08:50 - Jhyan: Idk you can put your parts into a power calculator
2020/09/23, 08:50 - Neo: I did. 277W
2020/09/23, 08:51 - Jhyan: Ok so anything above that
2020/09/23, 14:35 - Neo: How far did you get in ancestors
2020/09/23, 14:35 - Neo: The monkey game
2020/09/23, 14:37 - Jhyan: Not very
2020/09/23, 14:37 - Jhyan: Like the second generation
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Jhyan: Or third
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Neo: Bruh
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Neo: Do you still have it
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Neo: This game is pretty fun
2020/09/23, 14:38 - Jhyan: Yeah it is
2020/09/23, 14:39 - Jhyan: I played it and then I couldn't stop thinking about how everything is evolved
2020/09/23, 14:39 - Jhyan: Like every single thing people do
2020/09/23, 14:39 - Jhyan: I thought of a possible reason why we would develop that to survive
2020/09/23, 14:39 - Jhyan: You can unlock the ability for your tribe to copy your actions so stuff like scaring away predators is more successful
2020/09/23, 14:40 - Jhyan: And that's basically people mimicking each other
2020/09/23, 14:40 - Jhyan: Which happens
2020/09/23, 14:40 - Neo: Yeah I know
2020/09/23, 14:40 - Jhyan: I should play that again actually
2020/09/23, 14:41 - Neo: Yeah. A friend of mine is in the Sahara desert riding zebras
2020/09/23, 14:41 - Neo: Idk how true that is
2020/09/23, 14:41 - Jhyan: I didn't even know it gets out of the jungle
2020/09/23, 14:41 - Jhyan: Because I advanced generations and nothing really changed
2020/09/23, 14:42 - Jhyan: So I thought that I saw all the game had to offer
2020/09/23, 14:42 - Neo: Oh
2020/09/23, 14:42 - Neo: This game would be cool if you could go into civilisation
2020/09/23, 14:42 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/23, 14:42 - Neo: Or change the course of evolution
2020/09/23, 14:43 - Jhyan: If it eventually had farming settlements or something
2020/09/23, 14:43 - Neo: Yeah
2020/09/23, 15:12 - Neo: Do you remember spore. John used to love that game lol
2020/09/23, 16:14 - Jhyan: No
2020/09/23, 16:14 - Jhyan: I know of it
2020/09/23, 16:14 - Jhyan: But I never played it
2020/09/23, 17:19 - Neo: Oh okay, you dont think John'll like ancestors
2020/09/23, 17:22 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/09/23, 17:23 - Jhyan: I just said I don't remember spore because I didn't play it
2020/09/23, 17:23 - Jhyan: Maybe he would like it
2020/09/23, 17:23 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/09/23, 17:23 - Neo: Yeah
2020/09/23, 21:18 - Neo: https://youtu.be/dPXvMhwnf04
2020/09/23, 21:21 - Jhyan: Are you serious
2020/09/23, 21:21 - Neo: Yes
2020/09/28, 09:40 - Neo: Hey jhyan have you seen Deep Galactic Rock
2020/09/28, 09:40 - Neo: Seems like fun
2020/09/28, 09:40 - Jhyan: I have it
2020/09/28, 09:40 - Neo: That's cool
2020/09/28, 09:40 - Neo: How much is it
2020/09/28, 09:41 - Jhyan: Idk

2020/09/28, 09:43 - Jhyan: It's on sale rn apparently
2020/09/28, 09:44 - Neo: That and minecraft are going to be the first games I buy
2020/09/28, 09:44 - Neo: I'm halfway with my pc budget
2020/09/28, 09:47 - Jhyan: Nice
2020/09/28, 09:50 - Neo: I can't wait. Do you want to see my parts list
2020/09/28, 09:50 - Neo: Your opinion is one that I value the most
2020/09/28, 10:34 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/09/28, 10:51 - Neo: https://www.wootware.co.za/wishlist/index/index/
2020/09/28, 10:51 - Neo: Idk if you can see that
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Jhyan: Ok I'll look at it
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Jhyan: Oh nvm
2020/09/28, 10:52 - Jhyan: I'm just in class rn
2020/09/28, 10:53 - Neo: What's missing is the chassis, internal hard drive, M&KB
2020/09/28, 10:53 - Neo: And fans
2020/10/05, 09:06 - Jhyan: Does Alexia still use your Netflix
2020/10/05, 09:56 - Neo: No why
2020/10/05, 10:11 - Jhyan: Idk I just remembered it
2020/10/05, 11:32 - Neo: Remember this 🖕
2020/10/05, 11:33 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/05, 12:38 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/10/05, 12:39 - Jhyan: Oh no
2020/10/13, 08:12 - Neo: 978 895
2020/10/13, 08:13 - Jhyan: Subway surfers
2020/10/13, 08:14 - Neo: Yes and I am a God
2020/10/13, 08:14 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/13, 08:14 - Jhyan: I made a sticker of Saitama on a manga cover
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Neo: Oh that's cool
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Neo: It would be better if there were no boarders
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Jhyan: No I like borders
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Neo: And it's just his head
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Neo: Oh then dont do it lol
2020/10/13, 08:15 - Jhyan: Yeah but it would take too long to cut it out in a mobile app
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Neo: Each their own
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Neo: I used to do it all the time
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Neo: Do you like surreal art
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Jhyan: What is that
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Neo: Abstract I think
2020/10/13, 08:16 - Jhyan: No
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Neo: Not surreal
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Neo: Oh :(
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Neo: How come
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Jhyan: Because it's not really a thing
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Neo: Is that a valid reason not to like something
2020/10/13, 08:17 - Neo: It is
2020/10/13, 08:18 - Jhyan: If they had actual intentions behind it and can reasonably justify why they did it then fine
2020/10/13, 08:18 - Neo: They being the artist
2020/10/13, 08:18 - Jhyan: Art is in the eyes of the beholder
2020/10/13, 08:18 - Jhyan: I get to say whether it's art or not
2020/10/13, 08:18 - Neo: Yeah
2020/10/13, 08:19 - Neo: Should I show you what I'm talking about on instagram
2020/10/13, 08:19 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/10/13, 08:19 - Jhyan: But I'll only look after school
2020/10/13, 08:19 - Jhyan: They block Instagram
2020/10/13, 08:21 - Neo: Wow
2020/10/13, 08:21 - Neo: Isnt your profile picture abstract
2020/10/13, 08:22 - Neo: I really dont know much about drawing and painting
2020/10/16, 19:12 - Jhyan: Can I leave the group
2020/10/16, 19:12 - Jhyan: Like I will anyway but will it have any effect
2020/10/16, 19:13 - Neo: I was just about to say will it matter if I say no
2020/10/16, 19:14 - Neo: Is there a reason
2020/10/16, 19:14 - Jhyan: Ok so I'm just gonna leave
2020/10/16, 19:14 - Jhyan: Right
2020/10/16, 19:15 - Jhyan: Should I sent this lol
2020/10/16, 19:15 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/16, 19:16 - Neo: Yeah
2020/10/17, 09:55 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/17, 09:57 - Neo: Yeah lmao I've seen this one
2020/10/18, 09:16 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/18, 09:17 - Jhyan: I actually hate that "that's crazy" has become dismissive because I used to say it unsarcastically
2020/10/18, 09:18 - Jhyan: Now I don't know what to say when people tell me sub
2020/10/18, 09:18 - Jhyan: *stuff
2020/10/18, 09:18 - Neo: You can still say that's crazy
2020/10/18, 09:18 - Neo: I say that
2020/10/20, 15:10 - Neo: Jhyan I found an RX 5500 TX performs much better than the GTX 1660 S that was on my wishlist. But the RX card has a lower price which makes me doubt its reliability.
2020/10/20, 15:10 - Neo: What do you think should I get the Radeon card or the Palit card
2020/10/20, 17:26 - Jhyan: It's got a lower price because it's AMD and Nvidia has been overpricing their cards for a while now
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Jhyan: Get the AMD one
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Neo: Yeah?
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Neo: Oh okay
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Neo: If you really think so
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Neo: Thanks man
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Jhyan: Cool
2020/10/20, 17:27 - Jhyan: Lemme come over to build it when you get all the parts
2020/10/20, 17:28 - Jhyan: I built another friend's PC so I know what to do now
2020/10/20, 17:28 - Neo: Yeah ofc
2020/10/20, 17:28 - Jhyan: From experience instead of just theoretically
2020/10/20, 17:30 - Neo: Yeah I've seen it been done quite a few times but I still want your help
2020/10/24, 23:03 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/10/25, 06:13 - Neo: SPAGHETTI !
2020/10/28, 07:31 - Neo: What mouse do you use and did it come with the keyboard
2020/10/28, 07:37 - Jhyan: Razer deathadder
2020/10/28, 07:37 - Jhyan: It didn't come with my keyboard
2020/10/28, 07:37 - Jhyan: I used to have a RAT
2020/10/28, 07:37 - Jhyan: But it got old
2020/10/28, 07:38 - Neo: Do you think I should get that one
2020/10/28, 07:38 - Jhyan: The Razer deathadder is pretty solid
2020/10/28, 07:38 - Jhyan: Another guy I know also has it
2020/10/28, 07:39 - Jhyan: It's good quality
2020/10/28, 07:40 - Jhyan: It has 2 buttons on the side, led lighting, and a high DPI but those are the only things it has extra
2020/10/28, 07:41 - Jhyan: It's kinda expensive though I think
2020/10/28, 07:41 - Neo: I'm only really looking for an extra side button
2020/10/28, 07:41 - Neo: Yeah I just looked at it lol I think I could find a cheaper one that would suffice
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Jhyan: Damn mice are actually expensive
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Neo: Yeah lmao
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Jhyan: Maybe just get a cheap one to start out
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Neo: Keyboards seem fine but idk why the mice have high prices
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Neo: Yeah
2020/10/28, 07:42 - Jhyan: The mouse you have doesn't make that much of a difference
2020/10/28, 07:43 - Jhyan: https://www.incredible.co.za/redragon-3in1-gaming-combo-3-black?gclid=Cj0KCQjwit_8BRCoARIsAIx3Rj6gxXT7VGmMxkVrt2JKmBIUr90ISLX9rreINIHHC0HlgjdqDbk4oZ4aAnTZEALw_wcB
2020/10/28, 07:44 - Jhyan: Incredible connection overcharges but you can find those at like matrix
2020/10/28, 07:44 - Jhyan: I've seen them on shelves before they don't look like they're bad quality (redragon)
2020/10/28, 07:45 - Neo: All the redragon products I've bought dont work
2020/10/28, 07:45 - Jhyan: But there's other combos that actually look way better than buying individual

2020/11/05, 15:23 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/11/05, 15:23 - Jhyan: Why
2020/11/05, 15:24 - Neo: So that I know when you're available to help with the PC
2020/11/05, 15:24 - Neo: Unless I get help from another friend
2020/11/05, 15:24 - Neo: If you're not up for it
2020/11/05, 15:25 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/08, 21:19 - Neo: Yeah it's getting irritating, do you think I could use your mini generator thingy when we build my pc together
2020/11/08, 21:19 - Neo: If you want to help
2020/11/08, 21:20 - Jhyan: It doesn't work very well
2020/11/08, 21:20 - Jhyan: But yeah
2020/11/08, 21:20 - Neo: How do you mesn
2020/11/08, 21:20 - Jhyan: My dad bought this really bad one
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Jhyan: So I don't think it's powerful enough for my PC
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Jhyan: It might work on yours though
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Neo: We do have a generator that runs on gasoline I just hate using it
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Neo: Wait how many watts is your psu
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Jhyan: But anyway it's basically a battery that just saves sudden power loss, it's not for sustained use
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Jhyan: 750
2020/11/08, 21:21 - Neo: Yeah
2020/11/08, 21:22 - Neo: Oh ok mine is 650W
2020/11/08, 21:22 - Jhyan: Yeah so maybe
2020/11/08, 21:22 - Neo: Hope so damn
2020/11/08, 21:23 - Neo: My dad had this massive one that was supposed to.last for hours and when I asked him about it he said that the machines in general dont function too well
2020/11/08, 21:23 - Neo: Dont last long
2020/11/08, 21:23 - Jhyan: Yeah idk
2020/11/08, 21:23 - Jhyan: I didn't know those existed
2020/11/08, 21:24 - Neo: They get expensive too
2020/11/08, 21:24 - Jhyan: Unless he just means a battery like ones you use for solar panels
2020/11/08, 21:24 - Neo: Yeah I think so I kind of stopped listening
2020/11/09, 16:00 - Neo: What storage devices do you use
2020/11/09, 16:01 - Jhyan: 1. Brain
2020/11/09, 16:01 - Neo: Do you think it would be easier to buy all my components excluding ssd and then buy the ssd a month later and move the OS to the ssd
2020/11/09, 16:02 - Neo: Banher
2020/11/09, 16:02 - Jhyan: 2. Paper

2020/11/09, 16:02 - Jhyan: 7. Boxes
2020/11/09, 16:02 - Neo: How difficult is it to move the OS from the hdd to the ssd
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Neo: Gets funnier
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Jhyan: 8. Product packaging
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Jhyan: I use an HDD and ssd
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Neo: Yeah
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Jhyan: But I'm thinking of just transferring all my HDD stuff to an SSD
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Neo: You dont move files between storage devices
2020/11/09, 16:03 - Neo: Yeah is that difficult
2020/11/09, 16:04 - Neo: How do you that
2020/11/09, 16:04 - Jhyan: You can
2020/11/09, 16:04 - Jhyan: You just select everything on it and click cut
2020/11/09, 16:04 - Jhyan: And then paste it on the new drive
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: Well only for some files
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Neo: Can you do that with the OS
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: You have to uninstall programs from the old one and reinstall to the new one
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: No
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Jhyan: Idk how to do it with the OS
2020/11/09, 16:05 - Neo: I just realized what I said lmao
2020/11/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: >clicks cut
>Universe gets deleted
>mfw
2020/11/09, 16:06 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/09, 16:07 - Neo: Computer implodes
2020/11/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: With steam it makes it easy
2020/11/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: But you need to transfer the save files sometimes
2020/11/09, 16:08 - Jhyan: Idk
2020/11/09, 16:10 - Neo: I'm researching it
2020/11/11, 10:34 - Neo: Have you seen Darkest Dungeon
2020/11/11, 10:34 - Neo: Seems like your type of game
2020/11/11, 12:21 - Jhyan: Why
2020/11/11, 12:21 - Jhyan: I don't like the look of the gameplay
2020/11/11, 12:21 - Neo: Really? The game's mechanics
2020/11/11, 12:22 - Jhyan: What about them
2020/11/11, 12:23 - Neo: You can employ people and make them suffer for your own gain and when they reach a point of mental stress or something similar you just dispose of them and hire new people
2020/11/11, 12:23 - Neo: I like it but the way the game looks isnt my cup of tea
2020/11/11, 12:23 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/11/11, 12:23 - Neo: What about Project Winter
2020/11/11, 12:23 - Jhyan: Ok I'll look at it
2020/11/11, 12:24 - Jhyan: Idk explain it to me
2020/11/11, 12:24 - Jhyan: I can't really get information from googling it
2020/11/11, 12:24 - Neo: I think psychological damage is a better way of saying mental stress lol
2020/11/11, 12:24 - Neo: Its basically Amoung Us but 3D
2020/11/11, 12:25 - Neo: Or Dead By Daylight
2020/11/11, 12:25 - Jhyan: I've seen this
2020/11/11, 12:25 - Jhyan: It seems fun
2020/11/11, 12:25 - Jhyan: But like it needs people
2020/11/11, 12:25 - Jhyan: And the chances of it getting old for some people are high
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Jhyan: And everyone would have to buy it
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Neo: Yeah but Project Winter is pretty cheap
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Neo: And I have a few friends
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Jhyan: Well I'll look at it after exams
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Neo: I think it has public matchmaking
2020/11/11, 12:26 - Neo: Yeah
2020/11/12, 20:00 - Neo: What PSU do you use
2020/11/20, 18:55 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/11/20, 18:55 - Neo: 1 of them will end up being the joker
2020/11/20, 18:56 - Jhyan: Budget Joker
2020/11/20, 18:56 - Jhyan: You deleted this message
2020/11/20, 18:56 - Neo: This video is so fucking painful
2020/11/20, 18:57 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>
2020/11/20, 18:57 - Neo: Lol
2020/11/20, 18:58 - Jhyan: I read Tokyo Ghoul to see what manga is like
2020/11/20, 18:58 - Neo: Yeah? Do you like it
2020/11/20, 18:58 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: I thought I wouldn't because I don't like Western comics
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: They're really boring
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: The art is nice but they don't feel real
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Neo: Really?
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: Like they seem dead
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Neo: I like some of the DC comics
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Neo: Or really gruesome ones
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: Idk I've only tried Marvel ones
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Neo: Like the hills have eyes
2020/11/20, 18:59 - Jhyan: They're just kinda tedious
2020/11/20, 19:00 - Neo: ⛰️👁️
2020/11/20, 19:00 - Jhyan: Although the lore is also way better because movies don't want to add detail and also haven't had the time to build in huge arcs and irrelevant stuff
2020/11/20, 19:00 - Neo: Yeah ofcourse
2020/11/20, 19:01 - Jhyan: But I literally just read the lore on Wikipedia
2020/11/20, 19:01 - Neo: And I assume production of comic books is easier and cheaper compared to production of films
2020/11/20, 19:01 - Jhyan: Like that's more fun than having to start reading an entire fictional universe in comic format
2020/11/20, 19:02 - Jhyan: Yeah comic series have more leeway to fail
2020/11/20, 19:02 - Jhyan: So they can try interesting stuff
2020/11/20, 19:02 - Jhyan: But idk maybe the manga was just nice because I remembered that show
2020/11/20, 19:02 - Jhyan: I have to try it on a series I haven't seen before
2020/11/20, 19:03 - Neo: A manga I've seen around A LOT was chainsaw man
2020/11/20, 19:03 - Jhyan: Why
2020/11/20, 19:03 - Neo: Idk lol
2020/11/20, 19:04 - Neo: I dont even know if it's actually good
2020/11/20, 19:04 - Jhyan: I was gonna try out Deadman Wonderland
2020/11/20, 19:04 - Neo: But I wanted to read Beserk
2020/11/20, 19:05 - Jhyan: It's in shounen jump
2020/11/20, 19:06 - Jhyan: That's where some of the best stuff comes from so idk
2020/11/20, 19:06 - Neo: I think its just one of those books filled with gore and violence lol
2020/11/20, 19:07 - Neo: But with a gold art style
2020/11/20, 19:07 - Jhyan: Oh ok
2020/11/20, 19:07 - Jhyan: I just looked it up for 2 seconds
2020/11/20, 19:09 - Neo: Ive only seen a few frames and cover art
2020/11/20, 19:09 - Neo: Is it called cover art lol?

2020/12/10, 20:55 - Jhyan: I don't think you have to do this
2020/12/10, 20:55 - Jhyan: When Aidan did it it took less than like 20 minutes to set up the OS
2020/12/10, 20:56 - Jhyan: Literally just download the Windows Install Media onto a usb
2020/12/10, 20:57 - Jhyan: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10
2020/12/10, 20:57 - Jhyan: Download that onto a computer then run it and install it to a usb
2020/12/10, 20:58 - Jhyan: Oh it has instructions on the link I sent
2020/12/10, 20:58 - Jhyan: <Media omitted>

2020/12/10, 20:59 - Jhyan: This is what Aidan did
2020/12/10, 20:59 - Jhyan: I sound unsure because I was but everything is coming back to me
2020/12/10, 21:02 - Neo: Uh ok
2020/12/11, 13:24 - Neo: Have you seen A Silent Voice
2020/12/11, 13:55 - Jhyan: Yes
2020/12/11, 13:56 - Jhyan: That's the anime movie I tell people to watch to convince them that anime movies are actually amazing
2020/12/11, 14:16 - Neo: Yeah? Its pretty easy to just shit on the whole genre if you can call it that
2020/12/11, 14:16 - Neo: One of my top 3 movies is an anime movie
2020/12/11, 16:37 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/11, 16:37 - Jhyan: Anime got a bad reputation from it's toxic fan base
2020/12/11, 16:38 - Jhyan: And some of it is kinda cringe in itself
2020/12/11, 16:38 - Jhyan: But it shouldn't spread to masterpieces of film like some of the movies made
2020/12/11, 16:38 - Jhyan: It's literally just an animation style
2020/12/11, 17:08 - Neo: Yeah
2020/12/11, 17:09 - Neo: Well I'd argue there are some really entertaining shows and movies and some unbearable shows and movies. That's why I said you can't really call it a genre
2020/12/11, 17:09 - Neo: Say with indie (movies, games, music)
2020/12/11, 17:09 - Jhyan: Recently
2020/12/11, 17:09 - Jhyan: *exactly
2020/12/11, 17:10 - Jhyan: "live action" doesn't get shit on for all the bad content
2020/12/11, 17:10 - Jhyan: It's a medium not a genre
2020/12/11, 17:10 - Neo: Yeah that's better
2020/12/14, 08:46 - Neo: I have all my internals!
2020/12/14, 08:46 - Neo: I ordered the case, m&kb from takealot though. They said it's going to arrive on the 28th of december though
2020/12/14, 09:55 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/12/14, 09:55 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/12/14, 09:55 - Neo: Ye I can install cpu ram and M.2 rn
2020/12/17, 11:55 - Neo: Jhyan!
2020/12/17, 11:56 - Neo: <Media omitted>
2020/12/17, 12:06 - Jhyan: Really
2020/12/17, 12:06 - Jhyan: Yeah I'll get Borderlands 3
2020/12/17, 12:07 - Jhyan: And maybe monster Hunter
2020/12/17, 12:07 - Jhyan: Should I get Dying Light
2020/12/17, 12:07 - Jhyan: It's my favourite game but I pirated it
2020/12/17, 12:07 - Neo: Well I dont know if it's going to be these games, dont get your hopes up. They are doing this christmas thing though
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Neo: Yeah why not
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Jhyan: Then why is there a list of specific games
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Neo: I would also reccomend Far Cry 5. I got on PS for R70 and was definitely worth it
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Neo: I saw it in a tik tok lmao
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Jhyan: I pirated it and it is good but I stopped playing in
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Jhyan: *it
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Neo: But the Epic Games site says it's a mystery
2020/12/17, 12:08 - Jhyan: It takes too much time
2020/12/17, 12:09 - Neo: Theres a lot to do, lmao my cousin sped ran the game in a day
2020/12/17, 12:09 - Neo: Speed runned
2020/12/17, 12:09 - Neo: Speed ran
2020/12/17, 12:09 - Jhyan: How the fuck
2020/12/17, 12:09 - Neo: He just focused on the main missions or missions that give the most points for each area
2020/12/17, 12:10 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/12/17, 12:10 - Neo: The way the story is structured is really innovative
2020/12/17, 12:10 - Neo: More story driven games should do something similat
2020/12/17, 12:11 - Jhyan: What because you can do it in any order
2020/12/17, 12:11 - Neo: Maybe innovative is giving them too much credit but titles like Pokemon or anything from sucker punch
2020/12/17, 12:11 - Neo: Yeah
2020/12/17, 12:11 - Jhyan: Wdym
2020/12/17, 12:11 - Neo: Infamous and Ghost of Tsushima
2020/12/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: What about them
2020/12/17, 12:12 - Neo: Oh they should structure their stories in a similar way lmao
2020/12/17, 12:12 - Jhyan: Why sucker punch
2020/12/17, 12:13 - Jhyan: Oh actually Infamous 2 is my favourite game not Dying Light
2020/12/17, 12:13 - Jhyan: I forgot about that
2020/12/17, 12:13 - Neo: It's one of the only companies I could think of that make games where the games could fit that format
2020/12/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: But why
2020/12/17, 12:14 - Neo: Yeah Infamous 2 is top tier. I'm going to emulate it
2020/12/17, 12:14 - Neo: Idk because I dont play that many single player games
2020/12/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/12/17, 12:14 - Jhyan: Have you seen Control
2020/12/17, 12:15 - Jhyan: It's pretty good
2020/12/17, 12:15 - Neo: Yeah lol
2020/12/17, 12:15 - Neo: Def going to get it
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Jhyan: It's kinda like the SCP Foundation but more governmental
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Jhyan: I won't spoil though
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Neo: Is the SCP not a government owned company
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Neo: Thanks lol
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Jhyan: No it's international like WHO
2020/12/17, 12:16 - Jhyan: Or the CDC
2020/12/17, 12:17 - Neo: Ohh
2020/12/17, 12:17 - Jhyan: It's supported by governments but it's independent
2020/12/17, 12:17 - Neo: Ye
2020/12/17, 12:17 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/17, 12:18 - Neo: I bought borderlands on ps4 for R140 I like it
2020/12/17, 12:18 - Neo: Idk if you would though
2020/12/17, 12:19 - Jhyan: I was thinking of getting bl3 but it's super expensive
2020/12/17, 12:19 - Jhyan: So if this epic games thing is true I'll do that
2020/12/17, 12:19 - Neo: And it's on the epic games launcher
2020/12/17, 12:19 - Neo: They're pretty scummy
2020/12/17, 12:20 - Jhyan: Well it came to steam now I think but yeah
2020/12/17, 12:20 - Neo: Oh okay that's good
2020/12/17, 12:20 - Neo: The game can get a little repetitive though with the whole run and gun thing though
2020/12/17, 12:20 - Jhyan: Yeah
2020/12/17, 12:21 - Neo: But the variety of weapons and gear makes that part bearable
2020/12/17, 12:21 - Neo: Until you find a weapon so stupid that you can just progress using nothing else for 5 chapters
2020/12/17, 12:21 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Jhyan: Like Enter The Gungeon level weapons
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Neo: Yeah you can judge for yourself if its available
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Neo: Idk I never played that game properly
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Jhyan: You should
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Jhyan: It's really good
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Jhyan: I finished it last year or something
2020/12/17, 12:22 - Neo: Yeah there are so many things I want to play and try out
2020/12/17, 12:23 - Jhyan: But there's still a huge amount of content I haven't even seen
2020/12/17, 12:23 - Neo: Woah
2020/12/17, 12:23 - Jhyan: I haven't played it in a while though
2020/12/17, 12:25 - Neo: Yeah I will get it though
2020/12/17, 19:19 - Neo: NOOOOOOO!!!😭 its City Skylines not Dying Light meaning this list is doodookakashit
2020/12/17, 19:21 - Jhyan: Oh
2020/12/17, 19:21 - Jhyan: Damn
2020/12/17, 19:23 - Neo: Next game is revealed in 22 hours. It's going to be something garbage
